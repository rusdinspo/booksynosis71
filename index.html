Reprint.</p><p>"When someone we love is dying...<p> It's hard to know how to help, what to do, what to say. Yet if we know how to listen and what to look for, the dying themselves can often supply the answers, letting us know what they need to hear and express to allay their fears and face death with serenity.</p><p> For more than a decade hospice nurses Maggie Callanan and Patricia Kelley have tended the terminally ill.

The ship sets sail from Naples on a journey that will take them to some of the most remote-and wretched-outposts of the empire: Morocco, Algeria, and finally to Malta for a stunning and bloody battle on the high seas that will challenge even the battle-hardened Alatriste's resolve. <br><br> Now seventeen, ��igo is almost ready to leave Alatriste, his foster father and fellow soldier. But will age and experience bring wisdom, or is he likely to repeat many of his mentor's mistakes?</p><p>Arturo Perez-Reverte lives near Madrid. Originally a war correspondent, he now writes fiction full-time. His novels include <i>The Flanders Panel, The Club Dumas, The Fencing Master, The Seville Communion, The Nautical Chart,</i> and <i>The Queen of the South</i>. In 2002, he was elected to the Spanish Royal Academy.For this thinking person&#39;s swashbuckler full of poetry and rich prose, there&#39;s no better narrator than Michael Kramer. In dark, rugged tones hinting of Moorish vessels, flashing swords, and plunder, Kramer delivers the florid phrases that tell the tale of soldier of fortune Diego Alatriste. In Alatriste&#39;s sixth adventure, he is aboard the Spanish galley MULATA and is dedicated to making mincemeat of the REAL pirates in order to keep the Mediterranean&#39;s commercial lanes open for Spain. Kramer&#39;s somber narration gives way to spirited exchanges between Alatriste and his foster son, ��igo, then goes back to solemn accounts of a sailor&#39;s brutal life in the early seventeenth century. Perez-Reverte&#39;s novel is historically accurate--unflinching in its detail of bloody battle sequences and squalid living conditions. Kramer makes listening compelling.

Now in paperback, &#34;The Origins of the English Novel&#34; combines historical analysis and readings of extraordinarily diverse texts to reconceive the foundations of the dominant genre of the modern era.</p><p>"This book is a formidable attempt to articulate issues of almost imponderable centrality for modern life and literature. McKeon proposes with quite breathtaking ambition and considerable intellectual flourish to redefine the novel's key role in those immense cultural transformations that produce the modern world."&#x2014;Studies in the Novel <p>"One of the most rigorous and penetrating books I have read&#x2014;and one of the most widely researched, in its coverage of texts, theory, and historical developments."&#x2014;Vincent Newey, London Review of Books</p><p><b>Michael McKeon </b> is a professor in the Department of English at Rutgers University. </p></p><h2>Mrs. Mack</h2><p>Patricia had waited all her life for the summer that she can learn to ride a horse, and when her father takes her to a shabby old stable, she meets Mrs. Mack, with her snakeskin boots and big Southern smile, who teaches her everything about riding.</p><p>Studying in the United States and Australia<b>, Patricia Polacco</b> has earned an MFA and a PhD in art history, specializing in Russian and Greek painting, and iconographic history. She is a museum consultant on the restoration of icons. As a participant in many citizen-exchange programs for writers and illustrators, Ms. Polacco has traveled extensively in Russia as well as other former Soviet republics. She continues to support programs that encourage Russo-American friendships and understanding. She is also deeply involved in inner-city projects in the United States that promote the peaceful resolution of conflict and encourage art and literacy programs.&nbsp;The mother of a grown son and a daughter, she currently resides in Michigan, where she has a glorious old farm that was built during the time of Lincoln.Girls who love horses will strongly identify with Polacco's (Thank You, Mr. Falker) autobiographical story of a climactic Michigan summer. Ten-year-old Pat is thrilled when her father decides she's old enough to learn to ride. Pat assumes she is getting a horse of her own, but instead her father takes her to "Dogpatch," the poor area of his town. There they find a rundown stable owned by Mrs. Mack, a Southerner in snakeskin boots who, Pat's father says, "has forgotten more about horses than most people will ever know in a lifetime." Mrs. Mack takes Pat under her wing, and through her daily visits Pat learns how to forge relationships, not only with a difficult horse, but with two tough stable hands and Hap, Mrs. Mack's aloof neighbor. Finally, Pat realizes her dream of riding Penny, the beautiful mare that later becomes her own. Pat's inviting first-person narration allows readers to come along for the ride, as she slowly conquers her fears. While the length and density of the text tends to give equal weight to the events, both large and small, Polacco's drawings convey the emotions of each scene, adding emphasis to pivotal points. A moving afterword recounts the relationship between Pat and Penny after the summer's end.

But Pete should have figured that with a comfortable tax dodge in the sunny Florida Keys comes the inevitable knockout blonde looking for help. Sometimes life can be like the movies. Unfortunately for Pete, it isn&#x2019;t black and white.<br><br>There&#x2019;s more to the blonde than meets the eye. And fast on her stiletto heels is a hotshot Key West thug, his possibly duplicitous nympho daughter, a goon in control of the islands&#x2019; gambling boats, and a stone-cold corpse whose unexpected appearance has stripped Pete down to his last nerve. All he has to work with are what&#x2019;s left of his wits, a gun that&#x2019;s never been fired, and the dashing hope that he can survive this crime long enough to solve it. . . .</p><p>Pete Amsterdam struck it rich through no fault of his own, and he's put his novelistic ambitions aside with his business suits and retired to Key West to live in relative luxury, surrounded by his wine collection and music library. He never considered his PI license as anything but a tax dodge suggested by his accountant. So when a man who's supposedly been dead for two years turns up by the side of Pete's hot tub and asks him to help retrieve the money pouches he buried on a nearby island just before he disappeared, Pete is completely uninterested. But when the man turns up dead again, a beautiful blond yoga teacher who was his best friend convinces Pete to finger the killer and find the treasure--which is how a mild-mannered guy with a taste for the good life gets tangled up with a local mob boss, a gangster who runs a gambling ship, and his dangerous nymphomaniac daughter, ending up in a very funny caper novel that's Laurence Shames's best yet. The pacing ambles a bit, allowing lively digressions on the disparate characters, who end up at the end of the continent and reinvent themselves as regularly as the turning of the tides. This is a welcome addition to the growing shelf of Florida mysteries, and a fuller description of the hero's inner life than Shames has provided in earlier books. <i>--Jane Adams</i>&#x201c;BREEZILY ENGAGING . . .

So why is Sir Hugo Drax cheating at cards? Bond has just five days to uncover the sinister truth behind a national hero, in Ian Fleming&#39;s third 007 adventure.</p><p>Born in London in 1908, Ian Fleming worked as a banker and journalist before serving in the British Naval Intelligence during World War II. He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<b>1. SECRET PAPERWORK </b> <p>The two thirty-eights roared simultaneously.</p> <p>The walls of the underground room took the crash of sound and batted it to and fro between them until there was silence. James Bond watched the smoke being sucked from each end of the room towards the central Ventaxia fan. The memory in his right hand of how he had drawn and fired with one sweep from the left made him confident. He broke the chamber sideways out of the Colt Detective Special and waited, his gun pointing at the floor, while the Instructor walked the twenty yards towards him through the half-light of the gallery.</p> <p>Bond saw that the Instructor was grinning. 'I don't believe it,' he said. 'I got you that time.'</p> <p>The Instructor came up with him. 'I'm in hospital, but you're dead, sir,' he said. In one hand he held the silhouette target of the upper body of a man. In the other a polaroid film, postcard size. He handed this to Bond and they turned to a table behind them on which there was a green-shaded desk-light and a large magnifying glass.</p> <p>Bond picked up the glass and bent over the photograph. It was a flash-light photograph of him. Around his right hand there was a blurred burst of white flame. He focused the glass carefully on the left side of his dark jacket. In the centre of his heart there was a tiny pinpoint of light.</p> <p>Without speaking, the Instructor laid the big white man-shaped target under the lamp. Its heart was a black bullseye, about three inches across. Just below and half an inch to the right was the rent made by Bond's bullet.</p> <p>'Through the left wall of the stomach and out at the back,' said the Instructor, with satisfaction. He took out a pencil and scribbled an addition on the side of the target.' Twenty rounds and I make it you owe me seven-and-six, sir,' he said impassively.</p> <p>Bond laughed. He counted out some silver. 'Double the stakes next Monday,' he said. 'That's all right with me,' said the Instructor. 'But you can't beat the machine, sir. And if you want to get into the team for the Dewar Trophy we ought to give the thirty-eights a rest and spend some time on the Remington. That new long twenty-two cartridge they've just brought out is going to mean at least 7900 out of a possible 8000 to win. Most of your bullets have got to be in the X-ring and that's only as big as a shilling when it's under your nose. At a hundred yards it isn't there at all.'</p> <p>'To hell with the Dewar Trophy,' said Bond. 'It's your money I'm after.' He shook the unfired bullets in the chamber of his gun into his cupped hand and laid them and the gun on the table.' See you Monday. Same time ?'</p> <p>'Ten O'clock'11 be fine, sir,' said the Instructor, jerking down the two handles on the iron door. He smiled at Bond's back as it disappeared up the steep concrete stairs leading to the ground floor. He was pleased with Bond's shooting, but he wouldn't have thought of telling him that he was the best shot in the Service. Only M was allowed to know that, and his Chief of Staff, who would be told to enter the scores of that day's shoot on Bond's Confidential Record.</p> <p>Bond pushed through the green baize door at the top of the basement steps and walked over to the lift that would take him up to the eighth floor of the tall, grey building near Regent's Park that is the headquarters of the Secret Service. He was satisfied with his score but not proud of it. His trigger finger twitched in his pocket as he wondered how to conjure up that little extra flash of speed that would beat the machine, the complicated box of tricks that sprung the target for just three seconds, fired back at him with a blank .38, and shot a pencil of light aimed at him and photographed it as he stood and fired from the circle of chalk on the floor.</p> <p>The lift doors sighed open and Bond got in. The liftman could smell the cordite on him. They always smelled like that when they came up from the shooting gallery. He liked it. It reminded him of the Army. He pressed the button for the eighth and rested the stump of his left arm against the control handle.</p> <p>If only the light was better, thought Bond. But M insisted that all shooting should be done in averagely bad conditions. A dim light and a target that shot back at you was as close as he could get to copying the real thing. 'Shooting hell out of apiece of cardboard doesn't prove anything' was his single-line introduction to the Small-arms Defence Manual.</p> <p>The lift eased to a stop and as Bond stepped out into the drab Ministry-of-Works-green corridor and into the bustling world of girls carrying files, doors opening and shutting, and muted telephone bells, he emptied his mind of all thoughts of his shoot and prepared himself for the normal business of a routine day at Headquarters.</p> <p>He walked along to the end door on the right. It was as anonymous as all the others he had passed. No numbers. If you had any business on the eighth floor, and your office was not on that floor, someone would come and fetch you to the room you needed and see you back into the lift when you were through.</p> <p>Bond knocked and waited. He looked at his watch. Eleven o'clock. Mondays were hell. Two days of dockets and files to plough through. And week-ends were generally busy times abroad. Empty flats got burgled. People were photographed in compromising positions. Motorcar 'accidents' looked better, got a more cursory handling, amidst the week-end slaughter on the roads. The weekly bags from Washington, Istanbul, and Tokyo would have come in and been sorted. They might hold something for him.</p> <p>The door opened and he had his daily moment of pleasure at having a beautiful secretary. 'Morning, Lil,' he said.</p> <p>The careful warmth other smile of welcome dropped about ten degrees.</p> <p>'Give me that coat,' she said. 'It stinks of cordite. And don't call me Lil. You know I hate it.'</p> <p>Bond took off his coat and handed it to her. 'Anyone who gets christened Loelia Ponsonby ought to get used to pet names.'</p> <p>He stood beside her desk in the little anteroom which she had somehow made to seem a little more human than an office and watched her hang his coat on the iron frame of the open window.</p> <p>She was tall and dark with a reserved, unbroken beauty to which the war and five years in the Service had lent a touch of sternness. Unless she married soon, Bond thought for the hundredth time, or had a lover, her cool air of authority might easily become spinsterish and she would join the army of women who had married a career.</p> <p>Bond had told her as much, often, and he and the two other members of the 00 Section had at various times made determined assaults on her virtue. She had handled them all with the same cool motherliness (which, to salve their egos, they privately defined as frigidity) and, the day after, she treated them with small attentions and kindnesses to show that it was really her fault and that she forgave them.</p> <p>What they didn't know was that she worried herself almost to death when they were in danger and that she loved them equally; but that she had no intention of becoming emotionally involved with any man who might be dead next week. And it was true that an appointment in the Secret Service was a form of peonage. If you were a woman there wasn't much of you left for other relationships. It was easier for the men. They had an excuse for fragmentary affairs. For them marriage and children and a home were out of the question if they were to be of any use 'in the field' as it was cosily termed. But, for the women, an affair outside the Service automatically made you a 'security risk' and in the last analysis you had a choice of resignation from the Service and a normal life, or of perpetual concubinage to your King and Country.</p> <p>Loelia Ponsonby knew that she had almost reached the time for decision and all her instincts told her to get out. But every day the drama and romance of her Cavell-Nightingale world locked her more securely into the company of the other girls at Headquarters and every day it seemed more difficult to betray by resignation the father-figure which The Service had become.</p> <p>Meanwhile she was one of the most envied girls in the building, and a member of the small company of Principal Secretaries who had access to the innermost secrets of the Service - 'The Pearls and Twin-set' as they were called behind their backs by the other girls, with ironical reference to their supposedly 'Country' and 'Kensington' backgrounds - and, so far as thePersonnel Branch was concerned, her destiny in twenty years' time would be that single golden line right at the end of a New Year's Honours List, among the medals for officials of the Fishery Board, of the Post Office, of the Women's Institute, towards the bottom of the OBEs: 'Miss Loelia Ponsonby, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>She turned away from the window. She was dressed in a sugar-pink and white striped shirt and a plain dark blue skirt.</p> <p>Bond smiled into her grey eyes. 'I only call you Lil on Mondays,' he said. 'Miss Ponsonby the rest of the week. But I'll never call you Loelia. It sounds like somebody in an indecent limerick. Any messages?'</p> <p>'No,' she said shortly. She relented. 'But there's piles of stuff on your desk. Nothing urgent. But there's an awful lot of it. Oh, and the powder-vine says that 008's got out. He's in Berlin, resting. Isn't it wonderful!'</p> <p>Bond looked quickly at her. 'When did you hear that?'</p> <p>'About half an hour ago,' she said.</p> <p>Bond opened the inner door to the big office with the three desks and shut it behind him. He went and stood by the window, looking out at the late spring green of the trees in Regent's Park. So Bill had made it after all. Peenemunde and back. Resting in Berlin sounded bad. Must be in pretty poor shape. Well, he'd just have to wait for news from the only leak in the building - the girls' rest-room, known to the impotent fury of the Security staff as 'The powder-vine'.</p> <p>Bond sighed and sat down at his desk, pu...</p></p><h2>Dear Canada: That Fatal Night</h2><p>In the aftermath of the Titanic disaster, a young girl must come to terms with haunting memories from the voyage. It is May 1912, one month after the horrific sinking of the Titanic, and twelve-year-old survivor Dorothy Wilton is sent home from school in disgrace when she strikes another student. Although she&#39;s expelled, her sympathetic teacher encourages Dorothy to write an account of her experience on the ship, with the hopes that it will help Dorothy come to terms with her trauma. And so begins a truly remarkable story, which reads like a time capsule of the era: Dorothy writes about visiting her bohemian grandparents in England before setting sail back home, the luxurious rooms and cabins on board, a new friend she makes, and the intriguing people they observe. However, amidst all of this storytelling, a shadow lurks, a secret Dorothy is too traumatized to acknowledge - a secret about her own actions on that fatal night, which may have had deadly consequences. Through young Dorothy&#39;s eyes, award-winning writer Sarah Ellis expertly takes a unique perspective on the Titanic tragedy, exploring the concept of survivor&#39;s guilt with devastating honesty.</p><p></p><h2>No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist</h2><p>Bailey was one of the first to study live birds in their natural environment instead of studying speciments that had been shot and brought into the lab.

Humans have seen it as spirit guide and fanged enemy, as trade good and moral metaphor, as food source and symbol of ecological crisis. Eight thousand years of artifacts attest to its charisma, and to the fraught relationships between our two species. In the White Bear, we acknowledge the magic of wildness: it is both genuinely itself and a screen for our imagination.<br><i>Ice Bear</i> traces and illuminates this intertwined history. From Inuit shamans to Jean Harlow lounging on a bearskin rug, from the cubs trained to pull sleds toward the North Pole to cuddly superstar Knut, it all comes to life in these pages. With meticulous research and more than 160 illustrations, the author brings into focus this powerful and elusive animal. Doing so, he delves into the stories we tell about Nature&#x2015;and about ourselves&#x2015;hoping for a future in which such tales still matter.</p><p><p><i>Ice Bear</i> acknowledges the magic of wildness: it is both genuinely itself and a screen for our imagination.</p><b>Michael Engelhard</b> works as a wilderness guide in Arctic Alaska and holds an MA in cultural anthropology from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

By the author of Blanche Cleans Up.</p><p>Blanche White, Barbara Neely's smart, queen-sized, middle-aged African American sleuth, is a no-nonsense dame who's carrying some old baggage when she takes the summer off from cleaning houses for rich Boston matrons and returns to her North Carolina hometown. Almost a decade ago, Blanche was raped by David Palmer, scion of the town's leading family. Although she never brought charges against him, Blanche hasn't forgiven or forgotten. Now Palmer's sister is engaged to a sweet, mildly retarded young man for whom Blanche has a deep affection. When asked by his guardian to investigate the girl by using her connections with the domestics who know everything about the private lives of the town's most prominent families, Blanche sees an opportunity to bring the man who raped her to justice. The fact that he's been implicated in the murder of another woman makes revenge an even sweeter prospect. <p> What's most interesting about this lively series is the point of view of its heroine, a woman with a strong and clearly depicted perspective on the uneasy truce between blacks and whites in American society. Neely has created a true original in Blanche. With every new outing in this snappy series(<i>Blanche Cleans Up</i>, <i>Blanche Among the Talented Tenth</i>, <i>Blanche on the Lam</i>), she peels back more layers to reveal her heroine's emotional depths, her hard-earned wisdom, and her difficult but ultimately rewarding connection with the people she loves. Add love, hate, race, and homicide to Neely's expert characterizations, and you get a great read from a terrific, award-winning writer. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>BarbaraNeely is also the author of <i>Blanche Cleans Up</i>, <i>Blanche on the Lam</i>, and <i>Blanche Among the Talented Tenth</i>, for which she won awards that include the Agatha, the Anthony, and the Macavity.</p><h2>xxxHOLiC: AnotherHOLiC: A Novel</h2><p>Introducing the thrilling first novel set in the exotic, mysterious world of xxxHOLiC! Written by bestselling author NISIOISIN, and spectacularly illustrated by CLAMP, this original story features the ever-excitable high school student Kimihiro Watanuki, the mystifying time-space witch Y�ko Ichihara, and a host of fascinating new characters.<br><br>Nothing could have thrilled Kimihiro more than stumbling upon the bizarre wish-granting shop of the beautiful but unnerving Y�ko Ichihara, who solemnly promises to make the spirits plaguing Kimihiro go away just as soon as her fee&#x2013;rendered in daily afternoon chores at her shop&#x2013;is paid in full.<br><br>Of course, the thrill wears off as soon as Kimihiro realizes that his payment plan bears a disturbing resemblance to indentured servitude . . . eternal<i> </i>indentured servitude. Still he soldiers on, ready for whatever number of adventures lie ahead. But in Kimihiro&#x2019;s case, three may not be the charm!<br><br>His first assignment&#x2013;to procure a pair of fake eyeglasses&#x2013;is exceptionally pointless, even by Y�ko&#x2019;s standards. Or at least it seems that way, until Kimihiro watches a woman throw herself into traffic. He soon discovers that the doors of bespectacled perception can swing both ways. <br><br>Next, when a classmate seeks help solving a mystery involving text messages from the dead, Kimihiro is glad to play Sherlock. But he must turn to Y�ko to determine whether the root of the riddle is otherworldly shenanigans, deceit, or murder. <br><br>Finally, however ready, willing, and able Kimihiro thinks he is to face the most unusual of circumstances, he still finds himself completely bewildered by the stranger who chases away his darkest spirits, condemns Y�ko as a craven charlatan, and offers Kimihiro a way out of his preternatural predicament&#x2013;and<i> </i>a fortune besides.</p><p>Born in 1981, the prolific NISIOISIN has already revolutionized the Japanese literary world with his fast-paced, pop culture-fueled novels.

Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she snapped.<br><br>I looked up, surprised.<br><br>Her eyes were the same.<br><br>Still staring fixedly at me.<br><br>Then Y�ko Ichihara smiled faintly. &#x201c;Or perhaps . . . this way of putting things would work better with you, Nurie Kushimura-san.<br>&#x201c;Go ahead.

But that may well mean he becomes a powerful enemy.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;You can trust her. The rough way she talks is just a pose, and deep down she&#x2019;s really very docile.

It was a vision that was always with him&#x2014;a problem that nothing he did would ever solve. Seeing alone was bad enough, but there were also spirits that came to him, drawn by his blood, which always caused an unholy mess.<br><br>A mess he had to clean up.<br><br>He had done everything he could, but there had never been anything he could do in the first place. It would have made sense just to give up, and that might well have been the best thing he could do. But even so, even in full knowledge of that, there was not a day when he didn&#x2019;t wish.<br><br>If only I couldn&#x2019;t see.<br><br>That wish went through his head every day.<br><br>But it was less a wish than a prayer.<br>A few months ago, someone had promised to grant his wish.<br>&#x201c;This has got to be a joke,&#x201d; Kimihiro Watanuki muttered. No, the way he spit out the words was closer to a snarl, and his shoulders were shaking with rage. He was standing in front of the coin lockers outside the gates of JR Glass Station, about a ten minutes&#x2019; train ride east of the station closest to his high school, Cross Private School. The people around him had collectively decided to go out of their way to avoid his vicinity.<br><br>He was holding a letter in his hand.<br><br>A very short letter.<br><br>Fake glasses (not an eyepatch).<br><br>Perhaps more of a memo than a letter.<br><br>Watanuki glanced up again at the locker in front of him: No. 45.<br><br>The memo had been inside the locker.<br><br>&#x201c;She could have just said this! Why does she always have to be so roundabout&#x2014;and what the hell does &#x2018;Fake glasses (not an eyepatch)&#x2019; mean? Nobody in the universe would mix those two things up! Oh, wait, she&#x2019;s talking about Date Masamune, who founded that place where they make the Zunda Mochi . . . Sendai. Aggh! That&#x2019;s such a reach I can&#x2019;t even think of a comeback!&#x201d;<br><br>It was evening, rush hour.<br><br>Kimihiro Watanuki&#x2019;s very audible fury directed at someone who was not even there sent people moving swiftly away from him like an ebb tide, but he was in no mood to notice or care.<br><br>The day before, his employer had given him a key. The number 45 was inscribed on the key&#x2014;the key to this locker. His employer&#x2014;although besides Watanuki she oversaw only a paiyukimir of girls who may or may not have qualified as employees and a sort of pet thing like a black Yukimi Daifuku&#x2014;had given him no details or instructions beyond, &#x201c;Go open that door for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All that work I put into figuring out that this key came from the lockers outside Glass Station, and all I find is another order!? Is this a game for elementary school kids?&#x201d;<br><br>No amount of screaming in rage could heal the frustration.<br><br>All of his effort boiled down to his employer ordering him to find a pair of fake glasses. He did not venture to dream that things would end with the acquisition of said phony spectacles; that quest would soon be followed by some new order, which would in turn be followed by another, and another . . .<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s just toying with me. . . . This has absolutely nothing to do with my actual job.&#x201d;<br><br>His shoulders stopped shaking, and he slumped.<br><br>He appeared to have come to terms with it.<br><br>Indeed, no matter how absurd, no matter how obviously the request served her own amusement, as long as the orders came from his employer &#x2014;Y�ko Ichihara&#x2014;Watanuki had no choice but to obey.<br><br>Absolute obedience.<br><br>Why? Because it was a fair price.<br><br>The price he had to pay before his eyes would stop seeing.<br><br>&#x201c;Hahhh . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Y�ko Ichihara&#x2019;s shop, where Kimihiro Watanuki worked, was a shop that could make wishes come true. As long as one paid a reasonable price, no matter how extravagant or fantastic the wish&#x2014;even if you wished to not see spirits, to not have blood that attracted spirits&#x2014;this shop could fulfill your request.<br><br>A shop that granted wishes.<br><br>&#x201c;Except the way she&#x2019;s working me, it might just be faster to go out collecting dragonballs. Does she actually mean to grant my wish?&#x201d;<br><br>Watanuki had worked for Y�ko for several months now and was quite sure that she had the ability to grant wishes in return for that fair price. He was well aware of the extent of her power.<br><br>But he had his doubts about her intentions.<br><br>&#x201c;As much as she goes on about fair prices, she can&#x2019;t possibly expect me to work for free . . . but what does she want with fake glasses? She gonna wear them? Y�ko-san in fake glasses? Or is there some massive Warashibe Ch�ja&#x2013;style success lurking in my future? Will I end up rich? Gosh, what an exciting prospect. Damn it. Anyway . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He could not stand here fuming forever.<br><br>With that in mind, Watanuki forced himself to think. He had never bought a pair of fake glasses before, or even entertained a fleeting desire to do so, and literally had no idea where he could purchase such a thing. &#x201c;Fake&#x201d; meant that the lenses were just glass, so they could hardly be as expensive as functional spectacles. If she wanted sunglasses, he was sure the message would have said as much, so he should avoid tinted lenses. Which meant, in short&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know this area well, but surely there&#x2019;s one around.

Rafael St. James, prince of Bavia, demanded, bending as far out his chamber window as he could without plunging headfirst into the empty moat. </p><p> A light and drizzling rain was falling, that gloomy evening in late May, but he could see all too clearly. Annie Trevarren, a lithe, barefooted figure clad in a pair of kidskin breeches and a flowing shirt that might have been pinched from his own wardrobe, was embracing the face of a gargoyle on the crumbling parapet of the south tower. </p><p> Rafael felt an inward wrench at the sight of her, a tug born of something other than fear for her safety. </p><p> Beside him, his eighteen-year-old sister, Phaedra, fidgeted and wrung her hands. "Annie wanted a clear view of the lake," she said, as if that were reason enough to risk life and limb. "You mustn't be angry, Rafael, she can't help her adventurous nature -- boldness runs in the Trevarren family, you know.... </p><p> He cursed Miss Annie Trevarren <i>and</i> her alleged "adventurous nature" as he whirled away from the window and sprinted across the room toward the yawning doors, which stood a little ajar because of Phaedra's abrupt entrance. The princess scurried along behind him, moving as rapidly as her cumbersome skirts would allow and prattling the whole way. Rafael ran down the hall toward the enclosed staircase in the southern-most corner of the keep. </p><p> "Annie occasionally does impulsive things -- but she invariably regrets them later and makes up for her errors quite nicely, and she is extremely practical in most instances..." </p><p> Rafael ignored his sister's breathless blatherings in defense of her friend and schoolmate and ran as fast as he could, directing his thoughts to Annie. <i>Hold on, you little fool. Just hold on!</i> </p><p> His bodyguard and childhood friend, Edmund Barrett, reached the stairs at the same moment as Rafael. It was plain from the consternation in the other man's normally taciturn face that he had either been advised of Miss Trevarren's predicament or had seen it for himself. </p><p> "Let me handle this, Your Highness -- " he began. Barrett tended to address Rafael formally in any emergency. </p><p> Rafael shook his head and pushed past Barrett to mount the spiral steps. He was still the master of St. James Keep, however tenuous his hold on the rest of the country might be, and thus responsible for the safety of those within its ancient walls. Not to mention, the young woman's parents, Patrick and Charlotte Trevarren, were among his most valued friends. What would he say to them if Annie fell to her death -- that they still had four daughters left and shouldn't trouble themselves over the loss of the eldest? The little minx was a guest in his house -- had been for a week -- and it was his responsibility to look after her. </p><p> The door at the top of the staircase was open, of course, and Rafael stepped cautiously over the threshold. Annie stood several yards away, on the other side of a gap in the parapet, embracing the gargoyle with both arms. Her red-gold hair tumbled down her back and curled in the moist air. </p><p> "Don't worry, Annie!" Phaedra called, from just behind the prince's right shoulder. "Rafael will save you!" </p><p> "Be quiet and stay back," Rafael hissed, assessing the state of the parapet itself. The rain, smelling of settled dust, cooled his skin. To Annie he said, "Don't move." </p><p> Apparently, St. Aspasia's Academy for Young Women of Quality, where both Annie and Phaedra had spent the past few years learning manners and deportment, had served at least some part of its purpose. Even in that dire situation -- and it was dire, for the girl was standing on loose pebbles and very little else -- she smiled bravely and nodded, though she was pale and trembling. </p><p> "I won't," she promised, in a stoic tone. </p><p> Rafael indulged a perverse desire to look down. The brick floor of the courtyard seemed to spin in the gathering dusk and a number of spectators had congregated, their torches making spots of fire. He closed his eyes for a moment and offered a silent prayer to a God who had long since abandoned him, then eased out onto the ledge. </p><p> Some of the stone fell away beneath his feet, and he leaned back against the moss-slickened wall, arms spread wide, breathing deeply. Should the Trevarren chit be fortunate enough to survive this folly, he reflected, he might well murder her himself. </p><p> "Do be careful," Annie counseled, as though he were the one who needed rescuing. </p><p> Rafael felt color surge up his neck and pulse along his jawline as he moved closer to her, ever so slowly, progressing by inches, and fractions of inches. "I wasn't planning to hang by my feet or do handstands, Miss Trevarren," he replied reasonably. This was no time, or place, after all, to lose his temper. If they were both lucky, he would have that luxury later. </p><p> Once Rafael got her inside, he vowed to himself, he'd deliver a lecture this little hellion would never forget. After that, he might just throw her into the dungeon or hang her up by her thumbs. </p><p> He reached Annie's side on the strength of these fantasies and slipped one arm around her waist. "All right, Miss Trevarren," he said quietly, with a calmness he didn't feel. "Release your hold on the masonry, if you will, and we'll start back. It's going to be a slow process, though -- no sudden moves, or we'll both be splattered on the stones of the courtyard. Understood?" </p><p> Remarkably, he felt her bristle, ever so slightly, against his rib cage. "Believe me, Your Highness," she said with stiff dignity, "your instructions were quite clear." </p><p> Rafael risked a step, holding his breath, rejoicing inwardly when the parapet held. He muttered something meaningless, even to himself, and they progressed another step. Tiny bits of rock clattered down the tower wall, then tumbled soundlessly through space. The mist had turned to hard rain, soaking Annie's clothes and hair, extinguishing the torches below, and making the stones of the narrow walkway slippery as well as unstable. </p><p> Rafael stole a sidelong glance at Annie and saw that she was holding back tears, and that knowledge stung him out of all proportion to good sense. Miss Trevarren might have been foolhardy, but he secretly admired her boldness and courage. </p><p> "You'll be all right," Rafael said, in a gentler tone than he'd used before. </p><p> Annie snuffled. Like him, she pressed her back to the wall of the tower, one arm out wide for balance. They were a few inches nearer the door. "I was just thinking of my new yellow dress," she told him seriously. "It will be a shame if I never get to wear it. One must take joy in small things, you know." </p><p> For one rash moment, Rafael considered pushing her over the edge and being through with the matter. "That would be among my lesser concerns," he said tautly. Out of the comer of his eye, he saw that Barrett was in the doorway, holding a coiled rope. </p><p> "Only because you probably don't own a yellow dress," Annie replied, in a tone that somehow made the nonsensical sound rational. </p><p> Rafael felt a muscle twitch in his right cheek. The rope snaked out toward him, and he caught the end in his free hand, nearly losing his balance in the endeavor. "Yellow has never been my color," he answered dryly, and at great length. "Here. We'll tie this around your waist. If you fall while stepping across that chasm in the parapet, and you well might, don't panic and start screaming and flailing about. Barrett is more than capable of holding on and hauling you to safety." </p><p> Annie's eyes widened in her pale face, and for the first time, Rafael noticed that they were a very dark blue, the color of india ink. "What about you?" </p><p> He permitted himself a heartfelt sigh. Perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad thing if he fell; it would save the rebels the trouble of capturing, trying and finally hanging him, not to mention sparing the people of Bavia a long and costly civil war. </p><p> Tightening the rope around her middle and testing the knot as best he could, Rafael replied, "Indeed, Miss Trevarren -- what <i>about</i> me?" </p><p> "Ready?" Barrett called, through the thickening twilight. </p><p> "Yes," Rafael replied, looking down into Annie's upturned, rain-beaded face. In the next instant, before he could think about it too much, he maneuvered her around him. </p><p> She shrieked as a chunk of the parapet gave way and she fell, kicking wildly and clinging to the rope with both hands as she swayed, like a human pendulum, high above the main courtyard. </p><p> Rafael's breath burned in his throat and scalded his chest as he watched her. His own purchase was slipping; he could feel the walkway all but dissolving under the soles of his boots. Horrific images flooded his mind -- he saw the rope breaking, saw the Trevarren girl plummeting through space, heard her strike the stones below with such vivid clarity that bile surged into the back of his throat. </p><p> After that, the pictures became more confused; in an instant, he was back in the palace in Morovia, standing in the receiving line again, with his beloved Georgiana at his side, reliving the events of that night eighteen months before. His father, the last prince of Bavia, had been dead only a few weeks, and Rafael had just returned to the country after some twelve years of exile in England. </p><p> The scene unfolded quickly in his mind. </p><p> The stranger approached Rafael, the new and untested ruler and, before anyone could stop him, drew a small pistol from the pocket of his evening coat and aimed it at the prince's chest. </p><p> Georgiana had apparently seen what was happening, for she stepped between them at exactly the wrong moment, and took the bullet meant for her husband. </p><p> Rafael heard the shot echoing in his head and closed his eyes, too dizzy to move, but after a few seconds, he collected himself and looked toward the tower window just in time to see Barrett dragging Annie inside. </p><p> Relief swept through Rafael with such force that his knees went weak and again he pondered the attributes of death. If there was an afterlife, he might see Georgiana again, and Barrett's father. More of the parapet crumbled away into space, and he pressed his back hard against the wall, fingers clutching the time-beaten, porous stones. </p><p> "She's safe inside now, sir," Barrett said, raising his voice to be heard over the rising wind and the slashing patter of the rain. "Heads up, then. Here comes the rope." </p><p> It undulated toward him, that length of woven hemp, and Rafael caught it in both hands and held on with a ferocity that belied his earlier reflections on the advantages of dying. The last of the walkway collapsed while he was knotting the rope around his chest, and he felt its roughness bum into his hands as he slid, the knot giving way, almost to its end. </p><p> He slammed hard against the wall of the castle, blinded now by the downpour, focusing all his energy, all the strength of his being, on the simple process of holding on. Barrett pulled him upward, one lurching wrench at a time, while Rafael dangled, his palms raw where he grasped the slick rope. </p><p> At last, he felt hands, half a dozen of them, gripping him under the arms, by the wrists, by the back of his coat. They hauled him inside, Barrett, one of his lieutenants, and Lucian, Rafael's young half brother. </p><p> He crouched on the landing for several moments, soaked and bruised, his hands bleeding, his heart hammering against his breastbone, his breath grating like coarse sand in his lungs. </p><p> Barrett dragged him unceremoniously to his feet. "Are you all right?" he asked, with genuine concern. The affection between them was old, and it was deep. </p><p> Rafael managed a bitter, choked laugh, swayed slightly. When he spoke, it was in a furious rasp. </p><p> "Where is she?" </p><p> Annie had been waiting on the top step of the tower staircase, shivering with cold and residual terror, offering fervent, if silent, prayers that Rafael would be saved. Had she loved him, devotedly if from a distance, all these years, she'd asked herself, only to be the cause of his death? </p><p> At the sound of his voice, a low rumbling like summer thunder, however, both she and Phaedra stiffened in alarm. </p><p> The princess clutched Annie's hand and pulled. "Quickly!" Phaedra hissed, dragging her friend down the smooth steps toward the hallway. "If Rafael catches up to us now, there's no guessing what he'll do!" </p><p> Annie considered a couple of the possibilities and suddenly all the strength came back into her legs. Unencumbered by skirts, she bolted ahead of Phaedra and dashed blindly along the passage, having no earthly idea where to hide. Such was her unbridled agitation, alas, that she tripped on the comer of a rug and went sprawling onto the floor. </p><p> Before she could rise again, a pair of hard male hands hoisted her to her feet. She looked into the coldly furious face of the prince himself. </p><p> "Rafael -- " Phaedra pleaded, grasping her brother's arm. </p><p> He pulled free of his sister's hold, his storm gray eyes locked on Annie's face. He spoke to the soldier without looking away. "Take Miss Trevarren to her room and bolt the door. I'll deal with her in the morning. At the moment, I do not trust myself with the task." </p><p> Annie was cold and wet and full of remorse for giving in to the more daring side of her nature, but she felt a flush of indignation at his words and took umbrage at the tone in which they were delivered. "Why don't you just chain me to the dungeon wall and be finished with it?" she asked, with dignity. </p><p> "A delightful suggestion," Rafael bit out, still glaring at her. "And don't think I haven't considered it. Have you any others, Miss Trevarren? More drastic ones, I hope?" </p><p> She wilted slightly, for bravado will carry one just so far. Then, swallowing, she returned Rafael's icy stare, wondering what she'd ever seen in him and knowing, at the same time, exactly what. He was strong, he was handsome, he was good, and she couldn't so much as think about him without feeling a tug in her heart and a less prosaic response somewhere else. </p><p> "No," she conceded. "I haven't." </p><p> Only then did the prince unwrap his fingers from around Annie's arm. Mr. Barrett proceeded down the hall, with Lucian following at a reluctant pace and casting backward glances over one shoulder, but Rafael remained, towering there in that chilly passage like some dark specter. </p><p> Phaedra, loyal friend that she was, lingered stubbornly. </p><p> "Do not delude yourself into thinking that I will forget this incident, Miss Trevarren," Rafael said, bending until his aristocratic nose was almost touching Annie's impertinent, faintly freckled and upturned one. "We shall, as I said, take the matter up again in the morning." </p><p> The prince had plainly meant to intimidate Annie, and he'd succeeded, but she was too proud to let him see her trepidation. She squared her shoulders, lifted her chin, and refused to lower her eyes. Annie had learned long since, that one must, in the words of the Bard, assume a virtue if one has it not. </p><p> Rafael shook his dark head, murmured something blessedly incomprehensible...</p></p><h2>Mahabarata: The Epic--For Children</h2><p>The Mahabarata is one of the most widely read epics.

What the deconstructionists did for language, exposing its grave limitations and fallibilities, Elkins attempts to do for vision. As he convincingly demonstrates, ``vision is forever incomplete and uncontrollable because it is used to shape our sense of what we are.'' In Elkins's view, even the simplest, most reductive statement that can be made about seeing, ``the beholder looks at the object,'' is charged with such uncertainty and so many possible valences that it is incapable of any fixed or stable meaning. Seeing is also something that we have remarkably little control over, depending as it does on mood, thoughts, character, circumstance, etc., etc. Someone who is running late, for instance, suddenly becomes aware of a crowded world of clocks. As an art historian at Chicago's School of the Arts Institute, Elkins has a well-honed appreciation of the visual world, but he does have several substantial blind spots. He tends to cling too closely to his familiar tableaux morts, the unmoving, fixed images of paintings and photographs. Film and its shaping of vision are mentioned only in passing. Physics is similarly slighted, notably quantum mechanics and its discovery that the very act of perception can influence the results of an experiment. These omissions would not be so glaring if Elkins did not constantly try to find the telling in the trivial. Sometimes he is successful, such as in his discussions of animals' protective camouflage. But are six photographs of Chinese executions and a long discussion of the moment of death or extended disquisitions on nude models really relevant? In fairness, this is an enormous subject, and any account will be necessarily incomplete. Elkins is to be commended for shedding as much light as he does (and for elegantly abstaining from the temptations of academic jargon) in a ceaselessly thought-provoking book.

President Thomas Jefferson keenly understood that the course of the nation&#39;s destiny lay westward and that a national &#34;Voyage of Discovery&#34; must be mounted to determine the nature and accessibility of the frontier. He commissioned his young secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead an intelligence-gathering expedition from the Missouri River to the northern Pacific coast and back. From 1804 to 1806, Lewis, accompanied by co-captain William Clark, the Shoshone guide Sacajawea, and thirty-two men, made the first trek across the Louisiana Purchase, mapping the rivers as he went, tracing the principal waterways to the sea, and establishing the American claim to the territories of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Together the captains kept a journal, a richly detailed record of the flora and fauna they sighted, the Indian tribes they encountered, and the awe-inspiring landscape they traversed, from their base camp near present-day St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River. In keeping this record they made an incomparable contribution to the literature of exploration and the writing of natural history.Bernard DeVoto (1897-1955), winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a renowned scholar-historian of the American West and one of the country&#39;s greatest men of letters.</p><h2>Maleficent</h2><p>A deluxe novelization of the forthcoming live-action Walt Disney Pictures film explores the origins of one of Disney&#39;s most iconic villainesses from her own perspective. 75,000 first printing.

Everything in his mountain life that might seem a hardship to others-very plain food, crude and cramped quarters, dearth of human contact-Shih-wu celebrates as an outright virtue or at least preferable to what a city dweller can know....

That should've mattered. It probably would have in a different time, a different place. But this was Stillwater, Mississippi, and the only thing smaller than the town itself was the minds of the people living in it. They never forgot and they never forgave. Nineteen years had passed since Reverend Barker disappeared, but they wanted someone to pay for the loss of their beloved preacher. </p><p> </p><p>And they'd had their eye on Clay Montgomery from the beginning. </p><p> </p><p>The only bit of luck that had gone his way was that, without a body, the police couldn't prove Clay had done anything. But that didn't stop them and others from constantly poking around his farm, asking questions, suggesting scenarios, attempting to piece together the past in hopes of solving the biggest mystery Stillwater had ever known.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you think someday he'll come back? Your step-daddy, I mean?" Beth Ann Cole plumped her pillow and arranged one arm above her head.</p><p> </p><p>Annoyance ripped through Clay despite the beautiful eyes that regarded him from beneath thick golden lashes. Beth Ann hardly ever pressed him about his missing stepfather. She knew he'd show her the door. But he'd let her come over too much lately and she was beginning to overrate her value to him.</p><p> </p><p>Without answering, he kicked off the blankets and began to get out of bed, only to have her grab hold of his arm. "Wait, that's it? Wham, bam, thank you, ma�&#x20ac;&#x2122;am? You're not usually so selfish."</p><p> </p><p>"You didn't have any complaints a minute ago," he drawled, glancing pointedly over his shoulder at the claw marks she'd left on his back.</p><p> </p><p>Her bottom lip jutted out. "I want more." "You always want more. Of everything. More than I'm willing to give." He stared at the delicate white fingers clutching his darker forearm. Normally, she would've recognized the warning in his expression and let him go. Tonight, however, she went straight into her "how can you use me like this" mode, an act she put on whenever her impatience overcame her good sense. </p><p> </p><p>The cloying sound of Beth Ann's voice bothered Clay more than usual. Probably because he'd so recently had bad news. The police chief's daughter, Allie McCormick a police officer herself had returned to town. And she was asking questions.</p><p> </p><p>Swallowing a curse, he rubbed his temples, trying to alleviate the beginnings of a headache. </p><p> </p><p>The pounding only grew worse when Beth Ann's voice rose. "Clay, are we ever gonna move beyond a physical relationship? Is sex all you're interested in from me?"</p><p> </p><p>Beth Ann had a gorgeous body and occasionally used it to get what<i> she</i> wanted and he knew what she wanted right now was him. She often wheedled or pouted, trying to coax him into a marriage proposal. But he didn't love her, and she understood that, even if she liked to pretend otherwise. He rarely made the first move, hardly ever asked her out, never made any promises. He paid her way if they went anywhere, but that was a matter of courtesy, not a declaration of undying devotion. She initiated most of their contact.</p><p> </p><p>He remembered the first time she'd come to his door. From the day she'd moved to town nearly two years ago, she'd flirted with him whenever possible. She worked in the bakery of the local supermarket and did her damnedest to corner him the moment he crossed the threshold. But when he didn't immediately fall and worship at her feet, like all the other single men in Stillwater, she'd decided he was a challenge worthy of her best efforts. One night, after a brief encounter at the store, during which she'd made some innuendo he'd purposely ignored, she'd appeared on his doorstep wearing a trench coat and not a stitch of clothing underneath.</p><p> </p><p>She knew he couldn't ignore that. And he hadn't. But at least he didn't feel guilty about his involvement in her life. Maybe she liked to act as though he was the sex fiend and she the benevolent provider, but after experiencing her voracious appetite over the past several months he had his own opinions about who'd become the provider.</p><p> </p><p>"Let go of my arm," he said.</p><p> </p><p>Obviously uncertain, she blinked at the edge in his voice and released him. "I thought you were starting to care about me." </p><p> </p><p>Presenting his back to her, he pulled on his jeans. Sexrelaxed him, helped him sleep. Which was why he'd let his relationship with Beth Ann continue for so long. But they'd just made love twice, and he felt more wound up than ever. He couldn't stop thinking about Officer Allie McCormick. His sister Grace had told him she'd been a cold case detective in Chicago a damn good one. Would she finally bring an end to it all?</p><p> </p><p>"Clay?"</p><p> </p><p>Beth Ann was getting on his last nerve. "I think maybe it's time we quit seeing each other," he said as he yanked on a clean T-shirt. </p><p> </p><p>When she didn't answer, he turned to see her gaping at him. </p><p> </p><p>"How can you say that?" she cried. "I asked one question. One!" She laughed in a manner meant to suggest that he'd completely overreacted. "You're so jumpy."</p><p> </p><p>"My stepfather is not a subject I'm prepared to discuss." She opened her mouth, then seemed to reconsider what she was about to say. "Okay, I get it. I was tired and didn't realize how much the subject would upset you. I'm sorry."</p><p> </p><p>She should've told him to go to hell and walked out. He scowled. Although he'd tried to make it clear that he was the most emotionally unavailable man she'd probably ever meet, she was becoming attached. He didn't understand how, but there it was, written all over her face. </p><p> </p><p>He had to make a change. He wasn't even willing to admit he had a heart, let alone open it to anyone. "Get dressed, okay?" he said.</p><p> </p><p>"Clay, you don't really want me to leave, do you?" He used to send her home as soon as they were finished, so there could be no confusion about the nature of their relationship. But the past few times they'd been together, she'd faked sleep and he'd let her stay the night. </p><p> </p><p>Softening his stance had been a mistake. "I've got work to do, Beth Ann."</p><p> </p><p>"At one in the morning?"</p><p> </p><p>"Always."</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, Clay. Stop being a grump. Get back into bed, and I'll give you a massage. I owe you for that dress you bought me." </p><p> </p><p>She grinned enticingly but with enough desperation to make his neck prickle. He should've said goodbye a month ago. "You don't owe me anything. Forget me and be happy."</p><p> </p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. "If you want me to be happy, that means I matter to you."</p><p> </p><p>Determined to be completely honest or at least retain his hard-ass image he shook his head. "No one matters to me."</p><p> </p><p>As tears slipped down her cheeks, he silently cursed himself for not seeing this coming. Perhaps he'd relied too heavily on the fact that BethAnn wasn't a particularly deep person. Anyway, she'd get over him as soon as some other man strolled through the Piggly Wiggly.</p><p> </p><p>"What about your sisters? You love them," she said.</p><p> </p><p>"You'd take a bullet for Grace or Molly, even Madeline." </p><p> </p><p>What he'd done for his sisters was a case of too little, too late. But BethAnn wouldn't understand that. She didn't know what had happened that long-ago night. No one did, besides him, his mother and his two natural sisters.

Nothing. He dropped to his knees, howling in agony while a nearby coyote, startled by the sound, responded with a howl of its own. Rigid with pain, at first he couldn't even reach for the door handle. By the time he did, it was too late. The door lock inside the vehicle had already clicked home. </p><p> "Please," he begged. "For God's sake, open the door." </p><p> But the answer to that was no -- an unequivocal no. The engine turned over and the car began to move. </p><p> "You can't do this," he screamed. "You can't!" </p><p> By then the pavement was moving beneath him, slowly at first, then faster and faster. He held out his other hand, trying to brace himself or somehow pull himself back to his feet. For a moment that almost worked and he was close to upright, but then the speed of the car outdistanced his scrambling feet and he fell again, facedown this time, with the full weight of his body pulling on the exploding pain in his fingers. </p><p> As the speed of the vehicle increased, so did his agonized screams. The parking lot's layer of loose gravel scraped and tore at him, shredding his blue-and-white jogging suit; shredding his skin. By the time the hurtling car bounced over the first speed bump, he was no longer screaming. Plowing face-first into the second one momentarily knocked him unconscious. </p><p> He came to when the car door opened. Once his trapped hand was released from the door frame, he fell to the ground. He couldn't actually see the car or even the ground for that matter. He seemed to have been struck blind. Nor could he differentiate the pain in his crippled hand from the agony in the rest of his tortured body, but his ears still worked. He heard the car door slam shut again and felt the spray of gravel from the tires as it drove away into the night, leaving him in absolute darkness. </p><p> He lay there for a long time, knowing he was barely alive and feeling his life's blood seeping out through layers of damaged skin. He tried crawling, but he couldn't make that work. </p><p> "Help," he called weakly. "Somebody, please help me." </p><p> In the wilds of Phoenix's South Mountain Preserve, only a single prowling coyote heard the dying man's final whispered plea for help. The coyote was on the trail of his dinner -- an elusive bunny -- and he paid no attention. </p><p> No one else did, either. <b></b></p><p><b> * * * </b> </p><p> Sybil Harriman strode through the early morning chill and reveled in the sunlight and the clear crisp air. Across the valley, she could see the layer of smog settling in over the rest of the city, but here it was cold and clear -- cold enough to see her breath and make her nose run and her eyes water, but not cold enough to scare her away from walking the full course of the park's Alta Trail and back to the parking lot along the Bajada. </p><p> She had been warned that Alta was "too difficult" for someone her age, and that she certainly shouldn't walk it alone. So she did so, at least twice a week. Because she could. And as she walked along, huffing and puffing a little, truth be known, she was also drinking in the view and the cactus and the birds -- birds so different from the ones she'd grown up with back in Chicago -- and she was also thinking about how wrong she'd been and wishing things had been different. </p><p> Herman had wanted to move here the moment he retired from working for Merck. She was the one who had fought it, saying they should stay where they were in order to be closer to the kids and grandkids, although a lot of good that had done. Finally, when Herm's arthritis had gotten so bad that he could barely walk, she had relented. Now she was sorry they hadn't come sooner, while Herman would have been able to reap some of the benefits of desert living. </p><p> His arthritis had improved so much once they were in Arizona it was unbelievable, but then the rest of it had happened. The dry climate could do nothing at all to stave off the ravages and gradual decline that was Alzheimer's. As for the kids? Once Herm died, it had been plain enough that what they wanted more than anything was to get their greedy little hands on their father's money. Well, thanks to the trust Herm had wisely insisted on setting up, they weren't getting any of that, not until Sybil was damned good and ready. And that was another reason she walked every single day. She was determined to live as long and as well as she could. </p><p> <i>Let 'em wait,</i> she told herself fiercely as she marched along. <i>They can wait until hell freezes over.</i> </p><p> When she returned to Chicago for Herm's funeral, her friends there hardly recognized her. They thought she had dropped the </p><p> excess weight she had carried all those years in a fit of sudden grief. In actual fact, the process had been much less abrupt than that -- and much more permanent. She had started by walking four miles each day on the flat but circular streets in their Awatukee neighborhood. Later she had forced herself up and down the steeper grades and gradually more and more difficult trails throughout South Mountain Preserve. </p><p> Sybil was one of the early birds this crisp January morning. She had seen not a soul on her morning walk -- at least no other humans -- in the course of her almost three solitary hours. There had been plenty of bunnies, however, and scads of other early birds -- doves, quail, skittish roadrunners, breakfasting cactus wrens, finches, colorful hummingbirds, hawks, and even an ebony-feathered, red-eyed phainopepla. Now, as she approached the spot where the trail crossed San Juan Road, it was close to midmorning and the sun was high. </p><p> San Juan Road had been closed indefinitely for some strange reason, so there shouldn't have been any traffic. Still, Sybil was too much of a city girl to cross a road or a street without looking both ways. And that's when she saw it -- what appeared to be a pile of rags or trash lying in the middle of the roadway some thirty or forty yards northeast of the now abandoned San Juan parking lot. </p><p> Offended that someone would toss out a load of garbage and leave it there in the road, Sybil headed in that direction. She was determined to clean up the mess and haul it off to the nearest garbage containers. Ten yards or so away from the debris field, however, she saw the blood. </p><p> With a trembling hand, she pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911. "Emergency operator. What are you reporting?" </p><p> Sybil was closer to the mess now -- much too close -- and wished she wasn't. There was blood everywhere. It was hard to tell that the flayed and bloody pulp inside the pile of shredded clothing was even human, but she knew it was. </p><p> "A body," she managed at last. "I've just found a human body lying here in the middle of the road." </p><p> She didn't hear the panic in her voice, but the operator evidently did. "Calm down," the operator advised her. "What is your name and your location?" </p><p> Sybil took a deep breath and forced herself to get a grip. "Sybil Harriman," she replied. "I'm in the park -- South Mountain Preserve. The body is just to the east of the abandoned parking lot on San Juan Road." </p><p> "Units are on the way," the operator told her briskly. "Are you sure the person is dead? Did you check for a pulse?" </p><p> Sybil looked at the mound of bloody flesh, searching for wrists. One hand, virtually skinless, was little more than a bloody stump. The other hand contained a relatively recognizable thumb, but the four fingers seemed to have been mashed flat. Sybil knew at once there would be no pulse in either one of those two mangled wrists nor would there be any possibility of bringing the bloodied victim back to life. </p><p> "He's dead," she whispered to the operator. "Sorry. I've got to hang up now." </p><p> Sybil snapped the phone shut. Then, gagging, she staggered over to the edge of the road and promptly lost the single banana she had eaten for breakfast. </p><p> As she straightened up and waited, listening for approaching sirens, Sybil Harriman knew it was the last banana she would eat for a very long time. </p><p> Copyright � 2007 by J.A. Jance </p><p><b></b></p><p><b> Chapter One </b> </p><p> With her laptop asleep and perched virtually untouched on her crossed legs, Ali Reynolds stared into the flames of the burning gas log fireplace. She was supposed to be working on her blog, cutlooseblog.com, but on this chilly January morning she wasn't. Or maybe she was. She was trying to think of what to say in today's post, but her mind remained stubbornly blank -- right along with her computer screen. </p><p> Ali had started cutloose in the aftermath of the sudden and almost simultaneous ends of both her television newscasting career and her marriage. Back then, fueled by anger, cutloose had been a tool for dealing with the unexpected bumps in her own life. To her surprise, what had happened to her was far more commonplace than she had known, and what she had written in cutloose had touched chords in the lives of countless other women. </p><p> Since the murder of Paul Grayson, Ali's not quite, but nearly ex-husband, cutloose had morphed into something else entirely. For weeks now it had focused on grief and grieving -- on the pitfalls and setbacks that lie in wait for those attempting to recover from the loss of a loved one or even a not-so-loved one. Ali had learned enough from her readers that she could almost have declared herself an expert on the subject if it hadn't been for the inconvenient reality that she had zero perspective on the topic. She was still too deep in grief herself. As her mother, Edie Larson, would have said, drawing on her endless supply of platitudes: She couldn't see the forest for the trees. </p><p> Because Ali was back in her hometown of Sedona, Arizona, grieving. She grieved for a phantom of a marriage that had evidently never been what she had thought it was and for a job she had loved but which had come with zero job security and no reciprocal loyalty. </p><p> Having people write to her and tell her that "someday you'll be over it" or "it doesn't matter how ...</p></p><h2>American Wholefoods Cuisine: Over 1300 Meatless, Wholesome Recipes from Short Order to Gourmet</h2><p>Considered "the new <i>Joy of Cooking</i>" by authorities from <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> to <i>Vegetarian Times</i>, this major cookbook introduces a contemporary cuisine that "tastes great and happens to be healthy." 1300 recipes, plus 300 pages of valuable kitchen information. 580 pages, illustrated.</p><p>Cooking maven M.F.K. Fisher gave her approval to these 1,300 high-fiber, low-fat, low-sugar, and low-salt vegetarian recipes. And for someone who lived for flavorful food, that's sure saying something. The Goldbecks have been fixtures in the American whole-foods movement for more than a decade, and here they have thoroughly succeeded with their goal of creating "mouth-watering food that tastes great and happens to be healthful." <p> They call the whole-foods diet a "Darwinian" one because it's similar to the diet that our ancestors followed 50,000 years ago--"foods provided by our habitat." The Goldbecks write, "Just as we cannot put unleaded gasoline in our 1950 Chevy pickup and expect it to run efficiently, modern technological foods may be inappropriate for our prehistoric bodies." The simplicity of this theory is outstanding, although rushed lifestyles and the ubiquity of convenience foods make it easy to eat overprocessed, unnutritious junk at every meal. With most of its delicious recipes utilizing seven or fewer ingredients, however, <i>American Wholefoods Cuisine</i> can help you take the plunge into a healthier way of feeding your body.</p><i>In American Wholefoods Cuisine</i> we have combined our experiences to formulate a style of cooking that can serve a society in which people devote vastly different amounts of time to food preparation, have demanding taste buds, yet are thinking more than formerly about nutritional considerations. <p>The one dominant criteria for our recipe selection is that the food pleases us in the purely hedonistic sense of the word. If a dish doesn't make our taste buds dance, quite frankly we're not interested in it, no matter how nutritious it is.

In discussing the various types, the author guides readers through paperweight styles, clearly defining terms like upset muslin, piedouche, lampwork, and marbries. He goes on to point out the striking differences between inexpensive "gift" paperweights-most of which come from China or Venice-and the finer, more costly, usually one-of-a-kind paperweights. Also included are some history of paperweights, a glossary, a list of manufacturers and paperweight societies, and advice on their presentation and preservation. Although there are plenty of other books on this popular subject, this one stands out because of its clarity, good color photographs, and affordable price. Recommended for specialized art libraries and all public libraries.<br><i>Margarete Gross, Chicago P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.The fascination with glass-art-within-glass, as collector Reilly points out, is a relatively recent phenomenon--at least compared with other antiques. From its beginning in Poland in the 1830s, the craft of <i>millefiori</i> paperweights spread and took on colorful variations in such well-known French factories as Baccarat, Clichy, and St. Louis. Reilly prepares novices for their first collecting foray, explaining types as well as care and display. Color photographs bolster the text that sometimes drags. Those first venturing into this antique wonderland, compelled to do so by the publicity given to such collectors as the late Arthur Rubloff and such collections as that of the Corning Museum of Glass, will find it an interesting though expensive hobby. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Paddle Whispers</h2><p>OUR COPY HAS THE SAME COVER AS STOCK PHOTO SHOWN.

Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s Last Night</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The people of Wayo Wayo thought the whole world was but a single island.<br>&nbsp;<br>The island was situated in the midst of an immense ocean, far from any continent. As far as island memory reached, the white man had once visited the island, but nobody had ever left and brought back news of another land. In the beginning, people believed, there was nothing but a shoreless sea, until Kabang (the word for &#x201c;God&#x201d; in the Wayo Wayoan language) created the island for them to live on, as if placing a small, hollow clamshell in a tub of water. The island followed the tides, floating around in the ocean, which was a source of sustenance for the people. But some of the ocean&#x2019;s spawn were the avatars of Kabang. The <i>asamu,</i> for instance, was a black-and-white fish sent to spy on people, and to test them. For this reason, it was counted among the creatures that could not be eaten.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If you are so careless as to eat an <i>asamu,</i> you will grow a ring of scales around your navel, a ring of scales that you could never finish peeling off your whole life long.&#x201d; Leaning on a whalerib staff, the Sea Sage hobbled over and sat under a tree every day at dusk to tell the little ones all the stories of the sea. He talked until the sun dipped below the waves. He talked until the boys became youths, and until the youths endured the rite of passage and became men. His speech carried the smell of the sea, and there was salt on his every breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So what if we grow scales?&#x201d; one boy asked. The children here all had enormous eyes, like the eyes of a nocturnal animal.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh my child, people can&#x2019;t grow scales, just like a sea turtle can&#x2019;t sleep with its belly to the sky.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Another day, the Earth Sage took the children to the field in the hollow, to the place where the <i>akaba</i> grew. One of the only starchy plants on the island, the luxuriant <i>akaba, </i>a word that meant &#x201c;shaped like the palm of a hand,&#x201d; seemed to raise innumerable hands in supplication to the sky. The island was small and the people lacked farming tools, so pebbles were piled around the plots, to keep the soil moist and to serve as a windbreak. &#x201c;You must love the land, my children, and ring it in with your love. For the land is the most precious thing on this island. It is like rain, like the heart of a woman.&#x201d; The Earth Sage showed the children how to arrange the rocks. His skin was dry like cracked mud, and his back was arched like an earthen mound. &#x201c;In all the world, the only things worth trusting in are the land, the sea and Kabang, my children.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>At the southeast corner of the island was a coral lagoon, a good place to catch fish with thrownets or to collect clams. To the northeast, at a distance of ten husks (ten throws of a coconut husk) there was a cay, a&nbsp;coral reef that was fully exposed at ebb tide. This was where the seabirds flocked. The Wayo Wayoans hunted the birds with <i>gawana</i>. To make a <i>gawana,</i> they tied branches into a tool that had the virtues of club and spear, with one end blunt and the other end sharpened to a point; then they passed a rope of saltgrass through a hole in the blunt end and tied one end into a noose. Armed with a <i>gawana, </i>a fisherman would row his <i>talawaka</i> near the cay and let the ocean current carry him along, pretending to ignore the birds as he prayed to Kabang. When he drifted within range he would hurl his <i>gawana.</i> Blessed by Kabang, the noose would slip, just so, over a seabird&#x2019;s neck, and a deft flick of the wrist would impale the bird on the pointy end. Blood would trickle down from the point, as if the <i>gawana</i> itself had suffered a mortal wound. The only resistance the albatross, the booby, the pelican, the petrel and the seagull could put up was prolifer-ation. When the birds stopped in spring to build nests, people would feast on eggs, wearing cruel and satisfied smiles on their faces.<br>&nbsp;<br>As on any island, there was never enough fresh water on Wayo Wayo. The only sources were rain and a lake at the center of the island. Consisting mainly of fish and fowl, the diet was salty, giving the people a thin and dark appearance and often leaving them constipated. At dawn they would squat over pit latrines, facing away from the sea, often getting teary-eyed from the strain.<br>&nbsp;<br>The island was so small that most people could set out after breakfast, walk all the way around and return not long after lunch. For the same reason, people were accustomed to a rough parlance of &#x201c;facing the sea&#x201d; or &#x201c;facing away&#x201d; to orient themselves, and the only way to face away was to face the hillock at the center of the island. People talked facing the sea and ate facing away. They conducted rituals facing the sea, and made love facing away, so as not to offend Kabang. There were no chiefs among the people, only &#x201c;elders,&#x201d; the wisest of whom were called &#x201c;old men of the sea.&#x201d; The front door of the home of a family in which an old man of the sea had lived faced the shore. Adorned with shells and carvings, Wayo Wayoan houses looked like capsized canoes. They stuck fish skin to the walls, and the whole community would gather round and build a coral fence out in front to block the wind. The islanders could neither walk to a place where the sea could not be heard nor have a conversation in which the sea was not mentioned. In the morning, they greeted each other, &#x201c;Are you going to sea?&#x201d; At noon they asked, &#x201c;Shall we test our luck at sea?&#x201d; And at night, even if the weather had been too rough to go fishing today, they exhorted one another, &#x201c;You must remember me a story of the sea.&#x201d; As a rule, the Wayo Wayo went fishing every day. Fishermen who met on shore would yell, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let the <i>mona&#x2019;e</i> steal your name!&#x201d; <i>Mona&#x2019;e</i> meant wave. When people bumped into one another, one would ask, &#x201c;So how&#x2019;s the weather at sea?&#x201d; Even if a gale was blowing, the other had to reply, &#x201c;Very fair.&#x201d; The tonality of the Wayo Wayoan language was sharp and sonorous, like birdsong, with each utterance ending in a light trill and a plop, like a hungry seabird that swiftly dives and breaks the waves in search of prey.<br>&nbsp;<br>Occasionally, the people went hungry, the weather was too rough, or two of the villages would come into conflict; but no matter how he spent his days, everyone was skilled at telling diverse stories of the sea. People told tales at meals, when they met, at rituals, and when making love. They even told them in their sleep. A complete record had never been made, but many years later anthropologists might know that the islanders had the greatest number of sea sagas of any people on Earth. &#x201c;Let me tell you a story of the sea&#x201d; was on the tip of everyone&#x2019;s tongue. They did not ask how old people were, but simply grew tall like trees and stuck out their organs of increase like flowers. Like the obstinate clam they just passed the time. Like a sea turtle each islander died with the curl of a smile at the corner of his mouth. They were all old souls, older than they appeared, and because they spent their lives staring at the sea they all had melancholy miens and tended to get cataracts and go blind in old age. When they were ready to go, old folks would ask the youngsters by the bed, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the weather out at sea like now?&#x201d; People believed that dying while gazing at the sea was the grace of Kabang. Their lifelong dream was to arrive at the moment of death with an image of the ocean in the ocean of the mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>When a boy was born, his father would select a tree for him and carve a notch for each resurrection of the moon. When there were a hundred and eighty notches, the boy had to build a <i>talawaka</i> of his very own. Years before, the anthropologist S. Percy Smith had described the <i>talawaka</i> as a &#x201c;canoe.&#x201d; Actually, it was more like a grass boat. The island was too small to have enough trees with trunks thick enough to be made into canoes. Students of anthropological history smile at Smith&#x2019;s mistake, but nobody would laugh at him, as anyone who saw a<i> talawaka</i> would assume it was a dugout canoe. A <i>talawaka </i>was made by weaving sticks, rattan stems and three or four different kinds of silver grass together to form a frame and applying three coatings of plant pulp. Peat from the bog was used to plug any remaining cracks, and the craft was waterproofed with sap. A finished <i>talawaka</i> really did look like a finely finished canoe made by hollowing out the trunk of a sturdy tree.<br>&nbsp;<br>The finest and sturdiest<i> talawaka</i> on the island was made by a youth named Atile&#x2019;i. Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s face had the typical traits of his people: a flat nose, profound eyes, shining skin, a sad, slouching spine and arrow-like limbs.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i, don&#x2019;t sit there, the sea fiends will see you!&#x201d; hollered a passing elder upon seeing Atile&#x2019;i sitting by the shore.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>Once, like everyone else, Atile&#x2019;i thought that the whole world was but a single island drifting on the sea like a hollow clamshell in a tub of water.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having learned the art of <i>talawaka </i>construction from his father, Atile&#x2019;i was praised as the most skilled <i>talawaka</i>-maker among the island youth, even more skilled than his elder brother Nale&#x2019;ida. Though young, Atile&#x2019;i had the physique of a fish and could catch three ghostheads on a single breath. Every girl on the island pined for Atile&#x2019;i and hoped that one day he would waylay her, throw her over his shoulder and carry her off into a clump of grass. Three full moons later, she would discreetly inform Atile&#x2019;i that she was with child. Then she would go home, act normal, and wait for Atile&#x2019;i to arrive with a whalebone knife and a marriage proposal. Maybe that&#x2019;s what the most beautiful girl on the island, Rasula, was hoping for, too.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i has the fate of a second son. What good is a second son who can dive? Atile&#x2019;i is destined for the Sea God, not for Wayo Wayo.&#x201d; Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s mother often complained in this vein, and people would nod knowingly, understanding that raising an outstanding second son was the most painful thing in the world for any parent. Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s mother grumbled day and night, her thick lips trembling, as if the more she bemoaned her son&#x2019;s fate the greater his chance of avoiding it might be.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unless an eldest son died young, the second son seldom married and went on to become an &#x201c;old man of the sea.&#x201d; Upon reaching his one hundred and eightieth full moon, he would be sent out to sea on a mission of no return. He could take no more than ten days&#x2019; worth of water and was not allowed to look back. Hence the saying, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just wait until your second son returns,&#x201d; which simply meant, &#x201c;Perish the thought.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>With flashing eyelashes and sparkling skin, covered in crystals of salt, Atile&#x2019;i looked like the son of the Sea God. Tomorrow he would brave the waves in his <i>talawaka</i>. He climbed the highest reef-rock on the island and gazed down at the distant swells, at the white creases in the fabric of the sea. The seabirds flying along the shore reminded him of Rasula, who was as nimble as the shadow of a bird in flight. And like a shore pounded by the waves for many eons, his heart, he felt, was about to break.<br>&nbsp;<br>According to custom, Atile&#x2019;i&#x2019;s admirers laid ambush at dusk. Atile&#x2019;i had only to wander past a clump of grass and some young maiden would accost him. Every time he hoped the girl in the grass would be Rasula, but Rasula never appeared. Atile&#x2019;i made love over and over again to the girls in the grass, for this was the last chance he had to father a child and leave some small part of himself behind on the island. In fact, as a matter of propriety and morality, he could not refuse their propositions: the girls of Wayo Wayo could ambush a second son on the night before he went to sea. Atile&#x2019;i broke his back making love to the girls in the thickets, taking no pleasure, intent only on nearing Rasula&#x2019;s place before dawn. He had a feeling he would meet her there. Each girl along the way sensed that once inside her Atile&#x2019;i was in a rush to leave. Hurt, they all asked, &#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i, why don&#x2019;t you love me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You know that people can&#x2019;t pit their hearts against the sea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Atile&#x2019;i finally made it with pale fishbelly dawn on the horizon. A pair of hands appeared from inside the grass and lightly drew him in. Shivering like a seabird ducking beside a boulder to dodge a flash of lightning, Atile&#x2019;i could barely get an erection, not because he was exhausted but because the look in Rasula&#x2019;s eyes was like a jellyfish&#x2019;s sting.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Atile&#x2019;i, why don&#x2019;t you love me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who says I don&#x2019;t love you? But you know no man can pit his heart against the sea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They cuddled for a long while. Eyes closed, Atile&#x2019;i felt like he was hanging in thin air, gazing down upon the open ocean. He gradually became aroused, tried to force himself to forget that soon he would go to sea, wanting only to feel the warmth inside Rasula&#x2019;s body. At dawn, the villagers would all go down to the shore to see Atile&#x2019;i off. Except for the Sea Sage and the Earth Sage, nobody would have noticed that all through the night departed spirits of second sons had been coming home. They all wanted to ride with the youth whose skin sparkled like the son of the Sea as he piloted the <i>talawaka</i> he had fashioned himself, carrying a &#x201c;speaking flute,&#x201d; a final gift from Rasula, as he rowed away to the fate he shared with them, each one, the fate of every Wayo Wayoan second son.</p></p><h2>Yard Sale</h2><p><b>When a family has to leave their house and move to a small apartment, it&#x2019;s hard to let go of things&#x2014;but having one another is what counts.</b><br><br>Almost everything Callie&#x2019;s family owns is spread out in their front yard&#x2014;their furniture, their potted flowers, even Callie&#x2019;s bike.

Almost as one, the inhabitants of the room looked at the newcomer, a heavily bundled-up young lady obviously offended by the dire weather.<br><br>Shivering from head to toe, Mary Hurst grabbed the door with both gloved hands and struggled to close it. Her maid appeared and they finally secured the door, both panting from the effort. &#x201c;Thank you, Abigail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ye&#x2019;re welcome, miss.&#x201d; Abigail rubbed her arms and looked around the room with interest. &#x201c;Gor&#x2019;, miss, there do be a lot o&#x2019; folks in this establishment.&#x201d;<br><br>Mary undid the scarf that covered her chin and ears from the harsh elements and blinked at the gazes locked upon her. The harsh weather had driven all other travelers inside the only available inn on this particular stretch of long and lonely Scottish roadway.<br><br>Mary stepped through the wide arch that led to the common room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been so cold in all of my life.&#x201d;<br><br>Abigail rubbed her gloved hands together. &#x201c;Aye, &#x2019;tis as cold as a witch&#x2019;s teat!&#x201d;<br><br>Mary&#x2019;s face warmed to a hot burn as the two farmers and a well-bundled tradesman who sat around a table by the window guffawed. A clergyman who sat at the long buffet table sent Abigail a hard stare before he hunkered down over his plate. Meanwhile, in the far corner, two rough-looking laborers chuckled boisterously, winking when Mary sent a reprimanding glance their way.<br><br>&#x201c;Abigail, please watch your language.&#x201d;<br><br>Unabashed, Abigail grinned. &#x201c;Aye, miss.&#x201d;<br><br>She unwound her muffler and looked about the room with interest, her broad face brightening with an even broader smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Gor&#x2019;, miss, do look at all the <i>gentlemans</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>Mary turned a stern stare on her enthusiastic maid. &#x201c;Abigail, ladies do not stare in admiration at strangers. So let&#x2019;s <i>not</i> look at all of the gentlemen.&#x201d;<br><br>Abigail&#x2019;s smile dimmed. &#x201c;Very well, miss, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No &#x2018;buts.&#x2019;&#x201d; Mary removed her scarf, shaking off the melting snow. As she did so, she caught the gaze of the final occupant of the taproom. Dressed head to toe in unrelenting black, the man sat in the only chair beside the crackling fireplace. Larger than any other man in the room, he had broad shoulders and long legs that made even the heavy chair seem too small.<br><br>He was still wrapped in his coat and a heavy muffler partially concealed his face. That was a pity, for he had a most striking appearance: dark hair that fell over a noble brow; a strong, acquiline nose; and pale green eyes that caught and held her gaze.<br><br>Abigail said in an audible whisper, &#x201c;Miss, I thought we wasn&#x2019;t supposed to stare at the gentlemans.&#x201d;<br><br>Mary&#x2019;s face burned, certain that the man had heard her maid&#x2019;s unwelcome comment, but he merely favored them both with an indifferent glance before turning his gaze back to the snapping fire, his face a study of disdainful boredom.<br><br>Piqued by such an obvious dismissal, Mary turned her back on the stranger and yanked off her wool-lined gloves.<br><br>It was a most inhospitable welcome. There were no available chairs and not one of the male occupants had stood when she and her maid entered, much less offered up their seats.<br><br>But she could endure this and more for her brother. <i>This is for Michael. I cannot let him down.</i><br><br>She had a special place in her heart for her youngest brother. He had been sickly from the time of his birth until well into his teens, when, miraculously, he had ceased catching every illness that came through their village. Within a year, he&#x2019;d lost his worrisome cough, gained a golden tan, and grown four inches.<br><br>Though he&#x2019;d recovered fully, the long years he&#x2019;d been ill had shaped him in many ways. The hours he&#x2019;d been forced to lie upon the couch had left him with little to do but devour book after book. When his health had improved enough that he could attend school, he found he was far ahead of his classmates and, somewhere along the way, had become a scholar.<br><br>To his family&#x2019;s surprise, he&#x2019;d taken his fluent Greek and Latin, his advanced knowledge of sciences and histories, and had become the one thing none of them had expected... an Egyptologist.<br><br>Mary said the word in her mind, savoring it. It was a new term, come to usage only since Napoleon&#x2019;s Nile campaign. His troops had ravaged the Nile valley, and after Napoleon&#x2019;s defeat, their acquisition of a large number of ancient Egyptian treasures had enriched the coffers of the British Museum. Michael was a member of Britain&#x2019;s Royal Society, an organization founded in 1660 and comprised of energetic scientists who valued empirical evidence over everything else. The members took their role as the leading experts in the study of Egyptian artifacts very seriously indeed.<br><br>But Michael hadn&#x2019;t joined the society just to search for Egyptian artifacts. He was on a special quest that only the family knew about: to recover the Hurst Amulet, which had been stolen from an ancestor and gifted to Queen Elizabeth I. History suggested that the intrepid queen came to fear the amulet, thinking it possessed magical qualities, and had passed it on to a courier from a foreign land.<br><br>The problem was, no one knew which land. Over the years, Michael had become convinced that the amulet had ended up in Egypt, and he was determined to find it.<br><br>Mary was eager to hear what new clue Michael had unearthed. His life was so exciting, she thought wistfully. He was doing the very things she wished she could do&#x2014;adventuring, exploring, finding and purchasing historical artifacts for private and public collections. She, meanwhile, was the sole child left at home, and the care of their parents had fallen on her.<br><br>Not that she regretted it. She loved her parents and the vicarage, but sometimes her soul longed for excitement.<br><br>Right now, though, she could do with a lot <i>less</i> adventure, and a lot <i>more</i> warmth. Her hands and feet were freezing; she couldn&#x2019;t feel her toes at all.<br><br>She straightened her shoulders and gazed about the inn&#x2019;s common room in the way she imagined Michael would, coolly and without fear, meeting the gaze of every man present.<br><br>The farmers and tradesman in the corner lost their grins immediately, dropping their heads and muttering to one another under their breath. The clergyman turned bright red, then sniffed and returned to reading his well-worn Bible. The rough laborers stopped guffawing and shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Only the darkly garbed man by the fireplace didn&#x2019;t acknowledge her, but continued contemplating the flames as if searching the glow for the last book of Ramesses.<br><br>Fortunately, she didn&#x2019;t need him to pay attention to her. She&#x2019;d tamed the common room with just one look. &#x201c;Come, Abigail. Let&#x2019;s bespeak a hot meal and see to hiring an escort to New Slains Castle.&#x201d;<br><br>The clergyman&#x2019;s head snapped in their direction. &#x201c;New Slains?&#x201d; Thin and slight, he was almost swallowed by his frock coat and slouched muffler.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, New Slains Castle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Och, ye canno&#x2019; wish to go there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I do. I must speak with the Earl of Erroll.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; His gaze flickered past her, then back. &#x201c;The road is impassable. No one will take ye there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Someone will have to, for I&#x2019;ve very important business to conduct with the earl. Besides, the roads cannot be that bad; the ostler said it had only been snowing an hour or less.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but before that it was raining, so there&#x2019;s sure to be ice. The road is very steep in places and treacherous.&#x201d;<br><br>Abigail made a distressed noise. &#x201c;Miss, mayhap we&#x2019;d best bespeak a room fer a night or two until&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d come so far to fetch the item Michael needed to win his freedom, and she wasn&#x2019;t about to give up.<br><br>&#x201c;But, miss, ye&#x2019;d have t&#x2019; have yer head up yer arse to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Abigail!&#x201d; <i>This</i> is what came of traveling with a companion one had barely met.<br><br>Normally when Mary traveled, she took one of the serving girls who helped clean the vicarage, both well trained and genteel. Unfortunately, influenza had raced through their small hamlet just before Michael&#x2019;s urgent letter had arrived and both maids were ill. Mary had been left with no choice but to accept the only available female willing to travel to Scotland on such short notice, her groom&#x2019;s niece.<br><br>Abigail blinked in mild surprise. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s toward, miss?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That phrase is vulgar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Th&#x2019; one about stickin&#x2019; yer head up&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. It&#x2019;s not an appropriate expression.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nay? Even when &#x2019;tis the truth?&#x201d;<br><br>One of the farmers snickered loudly. Mary glared at him until he covered his mouth, though his shoulders still shook.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not proper <i>ever.</i>&#x201d; She tucked her gloves into her pocket. &#x201c;Now, we must find the landlord and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The outer door opened and a short, squat man came into the entry hall behind them. He was swaddled in a huge coat, a prodigious number of mufflers, and a thick woolen cap. Stomping his boots upon the floor, he paused on seeing Mary and her maid standing in the common room. &#x201c;G&#x2019;day. Can I help ye? I be Mr. MacEllis.&#x201d; The thick Scottish brogue was barely understandable.<br><br>Mary dipped a curtsy. &#x201c;I am Mary Hurst and this is my maid, Abigail. We would like to bespeak a private parlor, if one is available.&#x201d;<br><br>He <i>tsk</i>ed. &#x201c;Och, miss, we dinna have such a thing. &#x2019;Tis the common room or none.&#x201d;<br><br>Mary forced a smile. &#x201c;Fine, then. We&#x2019;ll find some chairs here. We&#x2019;d like some dinner as well. We haven&#x2019;t eaten since this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring ye out some Cullen Skink.&#x201d; At Mary&#x2019;s blank look, he explained, &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis stew made of finnan haddock, potatoes, onions, and whatnot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah! That would be lovely.&#x201d; It sounded appetizing and she loved stew, especially on cold days. &#x201c;All we need is a seat, then.&#x201d;<br><br>The innkeeper went into the common room and looked around. His gaze flickered over the farmers and tradesmen and fell upon the gentleman by the fire. &#x201c;Why, &#x2019;tis&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;MacEllis, there you are,&#x201d; the man said in a deep, rumbling voice. &#x201c;I came to try your whiskey, if you&#x2019;ve any left.&#x201d;<br><br>The innkeeper shot a side-glance at Mary and her maid. &#x201c;O&#x2019; course we do, er&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Hay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Hay, then. I&#x2019;ll bring ye a good tipple.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. After, of course, you&#x2019;ve seated your new guests.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; The innkeeper turned toward the wide bench by the buffet table. &#x201c;Vicar Turnbill, would ye mind scootin&#x2019; yerself down a wee bit? We&#x2019;ve guests, as ye can see.&#x201d;<br><br>The vicar looked as if he did indeed mind, but he gathered his Bible and plate and slid to the far end of the table, where he sat stiff-backed as if afraid his very air might be tainted by their presence.<br><br>The innkeeper gestured to the plank bench. &#x201c;There ye go, miss! I&#x2019;ll fetch yer stew and some bread.&#x201d; With that he hurried off, leaving them alone with the men in the common room once again.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I do hope there is a lot of stew, fer I&#x2019;m hungry enough to eat a hog&#x2019;s head all by meself.&#x201d; Abigail swung her cape from her shoulders and hung it on a peg by the door.<br><br>If every eye had been fastened upon them before, they were glued now, for Abigail&#x2019;s plain gray gown accentuated her astounding figure.<br><br>Abigail smoothed down her gown as she cast a winsome glance at the clergyman. The scrawny man gulped, his Adam&#x2019;s apple bobbing as he turned bright red. With a sputtered deprecation, he ducked his head into his Bible.<br><br>Abigail grinned as she took her seat, making certain she was facing the men in the room, whom she now favored with a simper.<br><br>Mary clutched her pelisse tighter and wished she could toss a muffler over Abigail. Never had there been such an attention-seeking maid. Resigning herself to the inevitable comments and stares, Mary took her seat at the end of the table.<br><br>As she did so, she found herself meeting the sardonic gaze of the stranger by the fire, his green eyes glinting with mockery. Her face heated and she resolutely looked away.<br><br>Mary wished she could teach Abigail a bit of decorum, but the girl was addicted to the attention her figure solicited, and Mary couldn&#x2019;t completely blame her.<br><br>Mary wouldn&#x2019;t mind being so blessed herself. She had the ample breasts, but the rest of her was ample as well.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t that she was fat, but she was <i>healthy.</i> She lacked both the slender, willowy figure favored by fashion and the hourglass figure that Abigail enjoyed. Mary&#x2019;s shape was more... squarish, a shape enhanced very little by the current style of gowns with their tiny puffed sleeves and waistlines directly beneath the breasts.<br><br><i>Stop thinking about such silly things! You need to focus on your mission.</i><br><br>Her throat tightened at the thought of her brother. His letter had assured them that he was well, but she knew from experience that his letters were often carefully edited for their parents&#x2019; eyes. Later on, when it was just him and Mary, he would tell her the <i>real</i> tales of danger and deception, excitement and&#x2014;sometimes&#x2014;tedium.<br><br>She knew more than any of their other siblings just how far some of Michael&#x2019;s letters were from the real truth, and it frightened her now in a way it never had before.<br><br>He was not doing well; she could feel it in her heart.<br><br>It would be a relief when they finally reached their destination, recovered the artifact from the earl, and met up with William, who should be sailing from France now to meet them at the dock in Whitby. William had gone to collect one of Michael&#x2019;s best friends and compatriots, Jean-Francois Champollion, to serve as a guide for the delivery of the artifact to Michael&#x2019;s captor. No one knew Egypt like Champollion.<br><br>If everything went as planned, Michael would be free within the next six weeks&#x2014;which was far too long to be a captive, but the best they could do.<br><br>The innkeeper returned carrying two bowls of steaming stew and a hunk of thick bread already buttered. Despite her worry for her brother, Mary&#x2019;s rumbling stomach welcomed the lovely stew.<br><br>As she ate, the travails of the last few weeks seemed to melt into insignificance. She was truly blessed to be able to make such a journey. Had either of her other brothers been home, it would have fallen to William or Robert to make the trip. Fortunately, Mary had been the only one available. Eager to go, she had overridden her parents&#x2019; objections with a calm assuredness that she hadn&#x2019;t always felt once the journey had begun.<br><br>Their travels had been far more difficult than she&#x2019;d expected. They&#x2019;d suffered a broken wheel on their third day, and then faced two days of slogging rain that had left the roads treacherously muddy and travel painfully slow. There were times she&#x2019;d thought it would be faster to walk than remain in the creeping carriage.<br><br>Then, as they&#x2019;d passed through Aberdeen, the rain had turned into snow, which had made traveling impossible until it eased up and the road became visible once more.<br><br>Abigail hadn&#x2019;t helped, either. The woman had chattered nonstop about things Mary had never done or thought to do&#x2014;lies she&#x2019;d told, men she&#x2019;d allowed to kiss her, and how she&#x2019;d once stolen a penny from a man who hadn&#x2019;t bought her a big-enough present.<br><br>Mary was certain Abigail had a good heart but...</p><h2>Morning of Fire: John Kendrick&#39;s Daring American Odyssey in the Pacific</h2><p><p><em>Morning of Fire</em> by Scott Ridley is the thrilling story of 18th century American explorer John Kendrick as he journeyed for land and trade in the Pacific. Set against the backdrop of one of the most exciting and uncertain times in world history, John Kendrick's odyssey aboard his sailing ship <em>Lady Washington</em> carries him from the shores of New England across the unexplored waters of the Pacific Northwest to the contentious ports of China and the war-ravaged islands of Hawaii, all while avoiding intrigues and traps from the British and the Spanish. <em>Morning of Fire</em> is riveting American and naval history that brings the era of George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson gloriously alive&#x2014;a tale of danger, adventure, and discovery that fans of Nathaniel Philbrick will not want to miss.</p></p><p><p>Four years after the Revolutionary War, America's independence was still in doubt. To survive, the new nation needed money and a vital surge in trade. In the back rooms of Boston, a daring plan was launched by a group of merchants and ship owners: to send two ships on a desperate mission around Cape Horn and into the Pacific Ocean. They wanted to establish new trade with China, settle an outpost on territory claimed by the Spanish, and find the legendary Northwest Passage&#x2014;the fabled waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The adventure would bring the world to the brink of war.</p><p>The man chosen to lead the expedition was John Kendrick&#x2014;a master navigator and a charismatic captain of privateers during the Revolution. On the far side of the world, Kendrick would have to rely on his bravery, his charm, and most of all his remarkable resolve to navigate unknown waters, negotiate with cutthroat imperialists from England and Spain, and form alliances with natives hit hard by early encounters with Europeans.</p><p>Seventeen years before Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific coast, Kendrick established the first American outpost on what would become Vancouver Island. He then traveled into the cauldron of an intertribal war in the Hawaiian Islands before moving into the far ports of Macao, China, and Kushimoto, Japan, where he narrowly escaped capture by a troop of samurai. Throughout the seven-year journey, Kendrick faced a subordinate officer who wanted to usurp his command, Spanish officials who wanted him captured, and a rival British captain who wanted him dead.</p><p><em>Morning of Fire</em> follows Kendrick through each perilous turn of his adventures aboard the <em>Lady Washington</em> and the <em>Columbia Rediviva</em>. This meticulously researched story uncovers the full scope of a landmark American voyage that came at the volatile close of the eighteenth century, a time when superpowers Spain and Britain clashed over territory and the fledgling United States stood caught in the middle. As Scott Ridley relates Kendrick's fateful struggle to plant the seed of an "empire of liberty" in the Pacific, he shapes a bold and exciting chronicle of a momentous odyssey. <em>Morning of Fire</em> is popular history at its best.</p><p>Descended from a long line of New England sailors and shipbuilders, Scott Ridley has written for the <em>New Republic</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, <em>Newsday</em>, the <em>Denver Post</em>, and other publications. He lives with his family in East Harwich, Massachusetts.</p></p><h2>Some Kind of Hero: The Remarkable Story of the James Bond Films</h2><p><b>The first biography of the making of the James Bond series, drawing on hundreds of unpublished interviews with the cast and crew</b><br><br> For over 50 years, Albert R. Broccoli&#x2019;s Eon Productions has navigated the ups and downs of the volatile British film industry, enduring both critical wrath and acclaim in equal measure for its now legendary James Bond series. Latterly, this family-run business has been crowned with box office gold and recognized by motion picture academies around the world. However, it has not always been smooth sailing. Changing tax regimes forced 007 to relocate to France and Mexico; changing fashions and politics led to box office disappointments; and changing studio regimes and business disputes all but killed the franchise while the rise of competing action heroes displaced Bond&#x2019;s place in popular culture. But against all odds the filmmakers continue to wring new life from the series, and 2012&#x2019;s <i>Skyfall </i>saw both huge critical and commercial success, crowning 007 as the undisputed king of the action genre. <i>Some Kind of Hero</i> recounts this remarkable story, from its origins in the early 1960s right through to the present day, and draws on hundreds of unpublished interviews with the cast and crew of this iconic series.</p><p><b>Matthew Field</b> is a film journalist with<i> Cinema Retro</i> magazine and an author, whose books include <i>The Making of The Italian Job </i>and <i>Michael Caine: You&#x2019;re a Big Man.&nbsp;</i>He was a consultant on the acclaimed James Bond documentary <i>Everything or Nothing</i>.&nbsp;<b>Ajay Chowdhury</b> is an attorney and has given legal consultation on motion picture, music, publishing, television, and theatrical projects.

What a challenge this can be!</p><p>Derek Prime and Alistair Begg provide practical advice for both the spiritual and practical aspects of pastoral ministry. They delve deep into topics such as prayer, devotional habits, preaching, studying, and specific ministry duties. The result is an essential tool for those in pastoral ministry.</p><b>DEREK PRIME</b> is an itinerant minister and writer. A former president of the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Church, Mr. Prime has served as a pastor for more than 30 years, the last 18 as minister of Charlotte Chapel, Edinburgh.

He is the daily speaker on the national radio program <i>Truth For Life</i> which stems from his weekly Bible teaching at Parkside, and is the author of <i>Made For His Pleasure, Lasting Love,</i> and <i>What Angels Wish They Knew.</i> He and his wife, Susan, have three grown children.</p><h2>Idiot Letters</h2><p>Look out, public relations; take cover, customer service -- Paul Rosa&#39;s letter is in the mail and his inventively imbecilic queries about consumer products have a way of eliciting equally idiotic and even more unlikely answers from some of America&#39;s biggest companies.</p><p></p><h2>A Smile on the Face of the Tiger (The Amos Walker Series #15)</h2><p>In Estleman&#39;s latest novel, Amos Walker is back on the streets of Detroit as he investigates the mysterious death of an ageing pulp fiction writer.</p><p>Amos Walker has a sharp eye and a sharper sense of the absurd. Pair these with a dry wit and a fondness for Scotch and you've got Detroit's answer to Philip Marlowe. Just trade the fedora for a Tigers' baseball cap. Loren Estleman's acerbically philosophical PI has been going strong for 13 novels and shows no sign of slowing down. In a funky, meta-textual noir riff, <i>A Smile on the Face of the Tiger</i> immerses Walker in the world of '40s and '50s American pulp fiction, where men clench lantern jaws and women (sorry, dames) wear silk stockings and cause trouble. <p> When a New York publisher asks Walker to track down author Eugene Booth, who's refusing to allow his classic <i>Paradise Valley</i> to be reissued, Walker's first instinct is to say no. But Booth's novel, about a Detroit race riot in 1943, fascinates Walker, especially after he finds Booth's dictation tapes. Booth has "a low fuzzy bass that might once have been rich and pleasant before too much whiskey, too many cigarettes, and three or more trips too many around a rundown block had hammered it into that dull monotone you hear at last call and over the loudspeaker in the eleventh inning of a pitchers' duel." Walker discovers that it's not just whiskey and cigarettes that have affected the author. His wife was murdered 50 years ago to prevent Booth from spilling the truth about the events he fictionalized.</p><p> Walker traces Booth to a rundown motel on the shores of Lake Huron. His presence there is no surprise, given his fondness for solitude and fish. But why is mobster Glad Eddie Cypress, who should be gearing up for a big book tour, holed up at the same motel? When Walker finds Booth swinging from the rafters, he decides to find out. When the number of people who wanted Booth dead starts multiplying, and a 50-year-old race riot and murder move back into the spotlight, Walker is hard-pressed to keep himself from becoming history.</p><p> Estleman's sardonic prose (the Detroit River is "the only spot on the North American continent where you could look across at a foreign country without seeing either wilderness or tattoo parlors") makes <i>A Smile on the Face of the Tiger</i> move energetically along. This noir veteran, never content to rest on his laurels, has produced another gritty winner. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Critically acclaimed and versatile author Loren D. Estleman has been called &#34;the absolute best in the hard-boiled business&#34; (Philadelphia Inquirer). Since the appearance of his first novel in 1976, Estleman has published forty-two books, including the Detroit series and many historical westerns. He is best known for the Amos Walker mysteries that put him in &#34;the top eschelon of American private-eye specialists&#34; (New York Times). He is also the author of The Wister Trace, a critical study of twenty-nine classic Western novels. His pastiches pitting Sherlock Holmes against Dracula and Jekyll and Hyde have been continuously in print since their first appearances nearly twenty years ago. Estleman is an authority on both criminal history and the American West. He has been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award. He is the recipient of seven national writing awards, including three Shamuses from the Private Eye Writers of America and three Golden Spurs from the Western Writers of America. In 1987, the Michigan Foundation of the Arts presented him with its award for literature. In 1997, the Michigan Library Association named him the recipient of the Michigan Author&#39;s Award. Estleman has been a judge for many literary honors, including the prestigious Hopwood Award given by the University of Michigan. He has written book reviews for many newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. In 1988, he covered the filming of Lonesome Dove for TV Guide. Estleman&#39;s previous Amos Walker novel, Never Street, received starred reviews from both Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews, had been featured in People as a &#34;Page Turner of the Week&#34;, and chosen by the New York Times Book Review as one of their &#34;Books of the Year&#34; for 1997.

But 87% of the population doesn't care: they're addicted to flashback, a drug that allows its users to re-experience the best moments of their lives. After ex-detective Nick Bottom's wife died in a car accident, he went under the flash to be with her; he's lost his job, his teenage son, and his livelihood as a result.<br><br>Nick may be a lost soul but he's still a good cop, so he is hired to investigate the murder of a top governmental advisor's son.

He lives in Colorado.&#39;This is Simmons doing detective noir with an SF sheen ... Simmons has, as ever, created a compelling, believable cast of characters, but it&#39;s not really Nick Bottom&#39;s travails that make this such a startling read. His trajectory is tightly plotted and there&#39;s an emotional undertow to his actions that&#39;s easy to empathise with, sure, but it&#39;s the world Simmons has made that&#39;s the thing here, a world that sits right next to ours and might actually be our world if we&#39;re not too careful - and it&#39;s not too late. This is a provocative, frightening book ... Flashback is a fascinating read and many, no doubt, will be outraged at what it suggests. It&#39;s a book that will stay with you days after you finish it, chewing over its implications and precedents; but it&#39;s also a thrilling detective novel with a grand compelling mystery at its centre and more heart than you might think&#39; SFX. &#39;...nothing will prepare you for Flashback, a book as relentlessly compelling and unsettling as it punishing to read ... Simmons accomplishes this mood so well that it&#39;s difficult to fault the book for essentially excelling at creating atmosphere and complex history for this universe&#39; Sci-Fi Now.</p><h2>Southern Living 1981 Annual Recipes</h2><p>This set includes: 1981-2006.

Our high-volume factory systems are creating new risks for food-borne illness, from E. coli to avian flu. Our high-yield crops and livestock generate grain, vegetables, and meat of declining nutritional quality. While nearly one billion people worldwide are overweight or obese, the same number of people&#x2014;one in every seven of us&#x2014;can&#x2019;t get enough to eat. In some of the hardest-hit regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the lack of a single nutrient, vitamin A, has left more than five million children permanently blind.<br><br> Meanwhile, the shift to heavily mechanized, chemically intensive farming has so compromised soil and water that it&#x2019;s unclear how long such output can be maintained. And just as we&#x2019;ve begun to understand the limits of our abundance, the burgeoning economies of Asia, with their rising middle classes, are adopting Western-style, meat-heavy diets, putting new demands on global food supplies.<br><br> Comprehensive in scope and full of fresh insights, The End of Food presents a lucid, stark vision of the future. It is a call for us to make crucial decisions to help us survive the demise of food production as we know it.<br><br> Paul Roberts is the author of <i>The End of Oil</i>, which was a finalist for the New York Public Library's Helen Bernstein Book Award in 2005. He has written about resource economics and politics for numerous publications, including the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i>, and <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and lectures frequently on business and environmental issues.</p><p>Paul Roberts is the author of The End of Oil, which was a 2005 New York Public Library Helen Bernstein Book Award finalist, and he is a regular contributor to Harpers Magazine. A long-time observer of both business and environmental issues, he is an expert on the complex interplay of economics, technology, and the natural world. He lives in Washington State.Paul Roberts critiques the current system of food production, both domestic and international, and it is a scary world. Roberts shows how seemingly disparate problemsfirst-world obesity, third-world hunger, food-borne pathogens, rising fuel costs, pollution, and climate changeare connected and are logical responses to an unsustainable large-scale, hyperefficient food system. William Dufris employs an energetic and lively manner to hold the listener&#39;s interest while maintaining a note of matter-of-factness that adds to the grimness and peril. He is adept at delivering the mix of seriousness and astonishment clearly intended by Roberts. Dufris&#39;s pacing is also entirely appropriate for material that is often complex. A faster pace could leave the listener behind; a slower one could dull the impact of the material.

As younger women, we spend a considerable amount of effort trying not to get pregnant. Then, when the time comes to completely reverse that mind-set, it can be a little disorienting. Please don't let me be pregnant somehow turns into Please let me be pregnant! The average woman in the United States spends 3 decades of her life (not necessarily all in a row) trying to avoid pregnancy and about 5 years trying to get pregnant, being pregnant, and going through the postpartum period, to get the two children most women say they want.1<br><br>However, during those 5 precious years (for you it may be only 1 or it could be a decade), how you live your life can help in big ways to determine how easily you will become a future mom. Although not everyone does it, planning and prepping your body appropriately for fertility and a healthy pregnancy are essential--both for you and for your baby.<br><br>If you are already pregnant, you could skip straight to Chapter 2, but I hope you will read this chapter anyway. You might learn some good stuff that will still be relevant to you. If not, let's start the preparation process for the pregnancy to come. And it is a process--an important one. Maybe you didn't expect that. And maybe you are trying to guess what I am getting at: "I am at a healthy weight." "I have no fertility issues that I am aware of." "What is she talking about?"<br><br>Not to worry. I'm gonna tell you.<br><br>OUR INADVERTENT PATH TO PREGNANCY PLANNING<br><br>I don't want to jump ahead too much, but in an attempt to stress the significance of this chapter let me say the following: Thankfully, Heidi is gay. No, it isn't because we like rainbows and pride parades. It's because we were doing IUI (intrauterine insemination), aka the turkey baster method, which forced us to the doctor before Heidi was pregnant and not after, like most heterosexual couples I know.<br><br>And these doctors asked a million questions, sent her to several other doctors, and ran a battery of tests, which I initially thought unnecessary and inconvenient. "We're gay," I thought, "not infertile, for God's sake! Get the baster and shoot her up. This is such a waste of time!" I was incredibly impatient and annoyed, until those tests revealed some surprising and extremely significant results.<br><br>It turns out Heidi had uterine polyps, a definite roadblock to conceiving naturally. Had we been a typical heterosexual couple, we likely would have tried to get pregnant for 2 years before discovering something was wrong. And had Heidi actually managed to get pregnant in spite of those polyps, she had thyroid issues she was unaware of, which could have caused major complications during her pregnancy, or even caused infertility, had they not been addressed beforehand.<br><br>As grateful as I finally was to have had this utterly inadvertent intervention, I was also a bit stunned. I remember thinking, "Why doesn't everybody go through this process?" If a perfectly healthy young woman found these unexpected conditions, wouldn't all couples want to know what their health status is before they start trying? Think of the time and heartache it would save those with fertility issues left in the dark month after month, wondering why the at-home pregnancy tests kept coming up negative.<br><br>Even more importantly, wouldn't everyone want to find out if they have any issues that could cause problems during and even after the pregnancy and resolve them ahead of time? Why don't all doctors recommend this to all their patients before they try to conceive--not just the gay ones sent to the fertility clinic as a "formality"?<br><br>I was also left wondering why a young, healthy woman would be hyperthyroid. And why was her uterus covered in polyps? Heidi saw her ob-gyn for regular checkups. Why didn't somebody catch this ages ago? Why hadn't her ob-gyn asked her if she planned on getting pregnant at any point, so all these issues could have been identified and rectified much sooner? This is really when my gears began turning. How could this whole process be backward for the majority of our population?<br><br>But there is much to tell, so let's start at the beginning. Don't worry, we aren't going back to the big bang--I mean the beginning of how Heidi and I came to learn about the importance and necessity of a prepregnancy plan and how we implemented it.<br><br>THE BEGINNING<br><br>This process started for Heidi and me in early 2010. At this time, I was working on a TV show called Losing It. On this show, I would move in with overweight families and coach them back to health. Of course, the families had kids, and for one of the episodes, I moved in with a family in Detroit who had two little girls.<br><br>One of the little girls was named Lily, and she was 9 years old. I adored her. I would wake up with them, pack their lunches, help them make healthier dinners, and talk about why we were switching out certain foods for other foods, like whole grain bread for white bread . . . and I loved it. Truly. I enjoyed my conversations with that kid more than any other conversations I was having in my life at the time.<br><br>Well, this rocked my world. Until this point I truly never thought I was going to have kids. I was very focused on my career and I had some fertility issues (which I will delve into momentarily), and the combo of the two had me relatively oblivious. After Lily, however, the genie was out of the bottle . . . and she wasn't going back in. Clich� as it may sound, I finally realized that family is the true meaning of life. I love my work, don't get me wrong, but having children transcends it all (in my opinion). They are the point. The whole point. I recognized pretty immediately that I was not going to get to the end of my life and think, "Wow, I wish I'd spent more time at the office!" The epiphany swept over me completely, and it altered my perspective forever. So now what . . . ?<br><br>At this stage, Heidi and I had been together for roughly 18 months. She was only 28 and her clock was ticking, but not very loudly. Prior conversations about kids were fleeting and brief. They went a lot like this: "Yeah, maybe we'll do that down the road," or "Sure, maybe one day." I didn't want to pressure Heidi, and I didn't know where life was going to take us as a couple, but I knew I needed to start getting my ducks in a row. Now before I tell you what came next, I need to share with you what came first.<br><br>YOUR HORMONAL HISTORY . . . AND MINE<br><br>I was a "fat kid." You might already know this, as I have written about it in previous books and my "before pic" has been splashed on nearly every talk show I have ever done. But just in case you didn't, I was chubby. To give you an idea of how chubby, at my heaviest I was about 170 �ds at just 5 feet tall. Now, I am 5'3" and roughly 115 �ds. So, as I said, I was a fat kid.<br><br>If you're wondering why I am bringing up being overweight in a book about maternity, the answer is simple: My weight and what caused me to become overweight had a significant impact on my hormone balance and my fertility potential later in life. I of course didn't know this at the time, and neither did anyone else, really. It was the '80s, and no one was even talking about whole foods or organic foods, let alone xenoestrogens (chemical com�ds that mimic estrogens in your system) or thyrotoxic foods (foods toxic to the thyroid gland) or obesogens (chemicals foreign to the body that disrupt hormone function and lipid metabolism, increasing the tendency toward obesity). Everything I ate or drank was completely processed and loaded with chemicals. Plus, I was relatively sedentary until I got into martial arts at about 13 years old. So not only had I been eating horribly, I also wasn't a very active kid. Insult to injury, I know.<br><br>My mom got me into martial arts, not necessarily because she thought I was fat, but because she thought I needed something to be passionate about. And she was right--I loved it. I started going several times a week, and the activity helped me gradually gain self-esteem and slim down. It didn't change my eating habits, though, so the stage was set for what came next. When I was around 15 years old, I had an ovarian cyst burst. This is not a fun experience, by the way. In fact, it is incredibly painful, and I honestly thought at the time, not knowing what was happening, that I was going to die. But I didn't die. They told me I had PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder of the endocrine system, and probably endometriosis, a condition causing troublesome and painful periods, in which the uterine lining (called the endometrium) tissue spreads and grows outside the uterus, causing the Fallopian tubes to scar and not function properly, if at all. Lovely. As if the teen years aren't difficult enough!<br><br>At the time, I was told that PCOS causes ovarian cysts, and that's what happened to me--cysts were growing on my ovaries, then bursting, causing me agony. (Our dream team ob-gyn expert, Dr. Suzanne Gilberg-Lenz, tells me that this is an "old-school" point of view and that actually, my pain was likely due to endometriosis. But at the time this was my diagnosis to explain the cyst formation.) I had always had troublesome menstrual periods, as well as acne and weight gain from insulin resistance--in other words, my hormones were definitely not functioning normally. I didn't know all this yet. All I knew was that my ovaries were "cystic."<br><br>Dr. V Says . . .<br><br>Our brilliant internal medicine doctor and endocrinologist, Katja Van Herle, MD (I call her Dr. V), has this to say about PCOS. As an endocrinologist, this is her area.<br><br>PCOS is likely named incorrectly. It isn't really a problem with ovarian cysts, though when the cysts are present, this often becomes problematic. In fact, many PCOS patients do not have ovarian cysts, but they do tend toward abnormal ovulatory cycles; anovulation (meaning a "period" happens but no egg is kicked out); irregular periods; often androgen dominance (which means higher levels of DHEA and testosterone); acne; hair growth in unplanned places (like the face, belly, and areola); and male-pattern hair thinning. Importantly, PCOS often includes insulin resistance (high insulin levels, prediabetes, or diabetes). This is key when it comes to getting pregnant but also while being pregnant, because it increases the risk of gestational diabetes.<br><br>Dr. Suzanne Says . . .<br><br>Here is what our awesome and vastly knowledgeable Yeah Baby! consulting ob- gyn, Dr. Suzanne Gilberg-Lenz, has to say about PCOS.<br><br>Approximately 20 percent of women today have PCOS. It has become rampant, and this has had an important impact on fertility. Early intervention is crucial to preserve fertility, so be sure to get checked for this problem before attempting to get pregnant.<br><br>Now the 40-year-old me would have thought, "WTF?! What is PCOS really? And what is endometriosis? What causes these? Do they typically occur together?" (Dr. V says no--they are mostly different processes, but when they happen together, they present a real challenge to fertility.) And what most disturbs me now is this question: Why would an otherwise healthy, active teenage girl have this? How did my body get so out of whack? What is the origin of this issue, and what holistic changes can I make to put my body back in sync?<br><br>The 16-year-old me, however, was thinking more along the lines of, "Is this birth control pill they want me to take going to make me gain weight?" I was 16; what can I tell you?<br><br>To make a long story short, as I grew older, my knowledge of fitness, nutrition, and endocrinology grew. By the time I was in my thirties, I had a strong understanding of the endocrine system and was incredibly well versed on how to manage my weight, immunity, and overall health via clean and active living. I hadn't had a cyst burst since I was in my midtwenties, and my periods were far less painful. I was able to manage my weight without starving myself and training my body into the ground. Fantastic.<br><br>At that point, I never even thought for more than about 5 minutes about ever getting pregnant. I was extremely focused on my career and didn't even know if I would want kids. But because of the PCOS and endometriosis, I figured from a very young age it probably wouldn't be an option for me anyway, at least not without substantial medical intervention. I knew my tubes were blocked from the endometriosis, and I would either need surgery or, most likely, in vitro fertilization. Knowing that I already had cystic ovaries and that I was an "estrogen-dominant" female (having particularly high levels of estrogen in my body), I was concerned that fertility drugs could increase my risk of ovarian cancer and pose other significant long- term health risks. So I wasn't about to go there. I was nervous about messing with my hormones, and I knew that while drugs and surgeries have allowed many women to overcome these issues to bear their own kids, I didn't feel like I could put my body through any more hormonal trauma than it had already endured. I had personally accepted the fact that maybe God had other plans for me. For all those reasons, I began to explore adoption.<br><br>Heidi supported me in all aspects of Operation Adoption. We certainly hoped to be together long term, but at that point in our relationship, we hadn't officially made that kind of commitment. As time passed, though, and I worked tirelessly to adopt a child, Heidi ended up very involved in the process. By 2011 it became obvious that this adopted child was going to be "ours." We were starting a family--together. But the adoption process can take years, and by mid-2011, there we were, still with no hope or sign of a referral for our child. We were feeling frustrated and hopeless.<br><br>Before I Go On . . .</p><h2>Practical Fishing Knots</h2><p>This guide is designed for anglers who need instruction in choosing the right kind of knot and on how to tie a knot that holds.

Goddard and the Birth of the Space Age</h2><p>More famous in his day than Einstein or Edison, the troubled, solitary genius Robert H. Goddard (1882-1945) was the American father of rocketry and space flight, launching the world's first liquid-fuel rockets and the first powered vehicles to break the sound barrier. Supported by Charles Lindbergh and Harry Guggenheim, through fiery, often explosive, experiments at Roswell, New Mexico, he invented the methods that carried men to the moon. Today, no rocket or jet plane can fly without using his inventions.<br><br> Yet he is the "forgotten man" of the space age. His own government ignored his rocketry until the Germans demonstrated its principles in the V-2 missiles of World War II. The American government usurped his 214 patents, while suppressing his contributions in the name of national security, until it was forced to pay one million dollars for patent infringement. Goddard became famous again, monuments and medals raining upon his memory. But his renewed fame soon faded, and Goddard's pivotal role in launching the Space Age has been largely forgotten.</p><p><strong>David A. Clary</strong>, former chief historian of the U.S. Forest Service, is the author of numerous books and other publications on military and scientific history. He has served as consultant to several government agencies and teaches history at Eastern New Mexico University at Roswell, where he resides.Americans of the WWII generation will probably recognize the name of Massachusetts-born scientist Robert Goddard (1882-1945), who frequently made the pages of American newspapers and magazines in the 1930s with his rocket experiments outside Roswell, N.Mex. Baby boomers and their children, however, may never have heard of this pioneer in the construction of liquid-fuel rockets. Clary, former chief historian of the U.S. Forest Service, attempts to clean Goddard's biography of the varnish applied in earlier biographies supervised by the scientist's widow and his close friend Charles Lindbergh. Goddard emerges here as a paradoxical man who relentlessly promoted his work, winning hundreds of thousands of dollars in Guggenheim grants, while shunning offers to collaborate with other scientists. Clary presents a clear and relatively straightforward narrative of his subject's life, but the book is undermined by his inclination to be a detail-oriented documentarian (describing every launch and its outcome) rather than taking the broader view of a historian. If readers skipped the book's last few pages, where the author sums up the significance of Goddard's work for rocket science, they might come away thinking that he was just another New England crank with a flair for self-promotion. Clary also fails to confront directly the question of whether Goddard's drinking habits undermined his work or just his health. Nevertheless, readers who come to this generally well-written biography with some knowledge of Goddard's significance will find much of interest to fill out their knowledge of this complex and fascinating scientist for whom NASA's Goddard Space Center is named. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Settlers</h2><p>Betrayal, tragedy, courage, and the love of two men--a bold naval hero and an ambitious, hardworking squatter-mark Jenny Taggart&#39;s struggle to make a new home in the rugged wilderness of eighteenth-century Australia</p><p></p><h2>The Sacred Stone</h2><p><p></p><b>A mysterious meteor brings treachery, discord, and violent death to those who seek to possess it in the sixth volume of these thrilling interlinked&nbsp;medieval mysteries</b>&nbsp;1067.

As an increasing number of food products shipped in tin cans arrived over the Santa Fe Trail, more materials were available to the area's tinsmiths. They used their skills on tins that once held such products as lard, kerosene, and oysters. The finished products were as unlimited as the creativity of the makers, from candle sconces to picture frames to mirrors to nichos and religious icons to children's toys.</p><p>Lane Coulter and Maurice Dixon, Jr., begin with a brief history of New Mexican tinwork and quickly describe the tools and techniques used and how to determine the period in which older pieces were made.</p></p><p>A beautifully illustrated book on the origins and history of traditional Hispanic tinwork.Lane Coulter has a masters degree in fine arts and is a metalsmith. He has held teaching positions at the University of Oklahoma and the Institute of American Indian Arts, Santa Fe. He is the editor of <i>Navajo Saddle Blankets: Textiles to Ride in the American West.</i><br><br>Maurice Dixon Jr. has an MFA and is a tinsmith himself. A resident of Santa Fe, he has a long-time association with galleries representing the regional folk arts of New Mexico.</p><h2>The Four Last Things (Simeon Grist Mystery)</h2><p>L.A. private eye Simeon Grist is led to The Church of the Eternal Moment when the woman he is paid to follow dies, and he uncovers channeling, televangelism, blackmail, and murder, and finds himself in mortal danger</p><p><p>Timothy Hallinan is the author of nine widely praised books: eight novels including the Bangkok thrillers featuring Poke Rafferty and a work of nonfiction. Along with his wife, Munyin Choy, he divides his time equally between Los Angeles, California, and Southeast Asia.</p>Simeon Grist, former professor of English at UCLA and fledgling L.A. private eye, makes his debut in this clever mystery. To propel his plot, Hallinan adroitly depicts a new religion with avaricious leaders, New Age channeling and an overlay of California kookiness. Hired by the head of security of Monument Records to follow employee Sally Oldfield, suspected of selling information to competitors, Grist develops a liking for the woman. Then she is brutally murdered, and Grist is shocked to find that an impostor assigned him to the case. Investigating on his own, he follows leads to the Church of the Eternal Moment, with its child oracle Angel Ellspeth, her oh-so-smooth personal physician Dick Merryman and its crew of Listeners to whom the faithful confess all. As Grist searches for clues, aided by a former girlfriend, Eleanor Chan, now writing for the Los Angeles Times , he is threatened, beaten and involved in another murder. Televangelism, brainwashing, research into the early 19th-century diaspora of new American religions and a most unusual ally lead Grist to the denouement of this very satisfying mystery. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Each New Day Complete and Unabridged</h2><p>Each New Day is a collection of short yet profound devotions for every day of the year from the heart of Corrie ten Boom.

Corrie ten Boom, best-selling author of The Hiding Place, was able to trust and serve God even in a Nazi concentration camp-and throughout the days that followed. In this book, she will help you, too, find hope, confidence, and wisdom for whatever comes your way.<br><br>Based on incidents from Corrie's fascinating life, each devotion illustrates Scriptural principles and attests to God's faithfulness. The result is a year-long candid reminder of the Christian's victory over sin, Satan, and death; of God's wonderful promises and care; of how the past, present, and future are all in God's hands; and how each new day brings a chance to serve and love Him more.Corrie Ten Boom was a writer and historian. She was born in the Netherlands in 1892. In February of 1944, an informer turned the Ten Boom family in to the Gestapo for hiding Jews in their watch and clock shop. Six family members and 30 friends were arrested. Casper, Betsie, and Christiaan Ten Boom died as prisoners. Because of a clerical error, Corrie Ten Boom was released, one week before all the women her age were killed. Ten Boom went on to tell her message of survival for the next 32 years in countries throughout the world. Her story became both a book and a movie titled The Hiding Place. Ten Boom died on April 15, 1983.</p><h2>The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book</h2><p>Book by Henkin, Bill</p><p></p><h2>Winston and Clementine: The Personal Letters of the Churchills</h2><p>Spanning the fifty-seven years of the Churchills&#39; lives together, a collection of letters, edited by their only surviving child, offers an intimate portrait of a remarkable partnership and provides intriguing insights into the great social and political events of the twentieth century. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>"I seize this fleeting hour of leisure to write and tell you how much I liked our long talk on Sunday," Winston Churchill wrote to Clementine Hozier in April 1908, shortly after their third meeting, "and what a comfort and pleasure it was to me to meet a girl with so much intellectual quality and such strong reserves of noble sentiment." They were married by September; he was 29, she 19. They would remain married--though, due to political circumstances, they were not always together--until his death in 1965. During that time, their daughter Mary Soames remarks, some 1,700 items of personal correspondence passed between the two. <i>Winston and Clementine</i> is far from a complete collection, but it does offer a comprehensive overview of their epistolary relationship and the deep love and mutual respect upon which their marriage was based. It may be somewhat disconcerting to see the man who stirred a nation to war with "blood, toil, tears, and sweat" and other memorable phrases sending "kisses to my sweet and beloved Clemmie cat," yet it also makes the imposing statesman seem more human.<p> Sometimes Clementine would send written messages to Winston even when they were together; it was an opportunity to gather her thoughts, or avoid taking up her husband's time with arguments when he was busy managing the war. In June 1940, for example, she told him that "there is a danger of your being generally disliked by your colleagues and subordinates because of your rough sarcastic and overbearing manner.... I cannot bear that those who serve the Country and yourself should not love you as well as admire and respect you." A few of the letters are accompanied by little cartoon animals that they would draw for each other: she always drew the posterior view of a sitting cat, while he would sketch pug dogs, and later pigs. Even toward the end, when they both had to deal with increased infirmity and tragedies among their children, they still found time to send "little love messages" to each other. Looking back at their marriage, with Soames's edifying commentary sprinkled throughout (as well as a quite well-done biographical dictionary), is an experience both revealing and touching.</p>Mary Soames, born in 1922, is the youngest and only surviving child of Winston and Clementine Churchill. During World War II she served in mixed antiaircraft batteries in England and northwestern Europe and accompanied her father as an aide on several wartime overseas journeys. In 1947 she married Captain Christopher Soames, later Lord Soames, the politician and diplomat, a vice president of the European Commission and the last governor of Southern Rhodesia. He died in 1987; they had five children. She is the author of Clementine Churchill: The Biography of a Marriage, which won the Wolfson Prize for history, A Churchill Family Album, The Profligate Duke, and Winston Churchill: His Life as a Painter.</p><h2>Empire of Illusion: The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle</h2><p>Pulitzer prize&#x2013;winner Chris Hedges charts the dramatic and disturbing rise of a post-literate society that craves fantasy, ecstasy and illusion.<br><br>Chris Hedges argues that we now live in two societies: One, the minority, functions in a print-based, literate world, that can cope with complexity and can separate illusion from truth. The other, a growing majority, is retreating from a reality-based world into one of false certainty and magic. In this &#x201c;other society,&#x201d; serious film and theatre, as well as newspapers and books, are being pushed to the margins. <br><br>In the tradition of Christopher Lasch&#x2019;s <b>The Culture of Narcissism</b> and Neil Postman&#x2019;s <b>Amusing Ourselves to Death</b>, Hedges navigates this culture &#x2014; attending WWF contests as well as Ivy League graduation ceremonies &#x2014; exposing an age of terrifying decline and heightened self-delusion.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Chris Hedges, the author of the bestselling <b>War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning</b>, is currently a senior fellow at The Nation Institute and the Anschutz Distinguished Fellow at Princeton University, and writes for many publications including <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Granta</i> and <i>Mother Jones</i>. He is also a columnist for Truthdig.com.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>I / The Illusion of Literacy<br><br><i>Now the death of God combined with the perfection of the image has brought us to a whole new state of expectation. We are the image. We are the viewer and the viewed. There is no other distracting presence. And that image has all the Godly powers. It kills at will. Kills effortlessly. Kills beautifully. It dispenses morality. Judges endlessly. The electronic image is man as God and the ritual involved leads us not to a mysterious Holy Trinity but back to ourselves. In the absence of a clear understanding that we are now the only source, these images cannot help but return to the expression of magic and fear proper to idolatrous societies. This in turn facilitates the use of the electronic image as propaganda by whoever can control some part of it.<br></i>&#x2013;John Ralston Saul, <i>Voltaire&#x2019;s Bastards<br>We had fed the heart on fantasy,<br>The heart&#x2019;s grown brutal from the fare.<br></i>&#x2013;William Butler Yeats,<br><i>The Stare&#x2019;s Nest By My Window<br></i><br><br>John Bradshaw Layfield, tall, clean-cut, in a collared shirt and white Stetson hat, stands in the center of the ring holding a heavy black microphone. Layfield plays wrestling tycoon JBL on the World Wrestling Entertainment tour. The arena is filled with hooting and jeering fans, including families with children. The crowd yells and boos at JBL, who has had a long career as a professional wrestler. Many chant, &#x201c;You suck! You suck! You suck!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Last week I made Shawn Michaels an offer, and I have yet to hear back from the Heartbreak Kid,&#x201d; drawls Layfield. Michaels, another WWE wrestler, is a crowd favorite. He is a self-professed born-again Christian with a working-man persona. &#x201c;So earlier today I made Shawn Michaels an offer that was a lot easier to understand,&#x201d; Layfield continues. &#x201c;I challenge Shawn Michaels to a street fight tonight! So Shawn, I know you&#x2019;re back there. Now what&#x2019;s your answer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;HBK, HBK, HBK!!!&#x201d; the crowd intones. A pulsing rock beat suddenly shakes the arena as action shots of the Heartbreak Kid flash across the Titantron, the massive screen suspended over the ring. The crowd cheers, leaping up as Shawn Michaels, in jeans and an army-green shirt, whirls onstage, his long, blond hair flying. Pyrotechnics explode. The deafening sound system growls, &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m sexy . . . I got the looks . . . that drive the girls wild. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Michaels bursts into the ring, fists pumping, stalking back and forth. The ref steps in to begin the match.<br><br>&#x201c;HBK! HBK! HBK!&#x201d; chants the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on, hold on, referee,&#x201d; Layfield says, putting his hand on the referee&#x2019;s shoulder. People in the crowd begin to heckle.<br><br>&#x201c;Shawn,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;you got a choice to make. You can either fight me right now in this street fight, or you can do the right thing for you, your family, and your extended family, and take care of them in a financial crisis you never dreamed would happen a year ago today.&#x201d;<br><br>Michaels stands silently.<br><br>&#x201c;You see, I know some things, Shawn,&#x201d; continues Layfield. &#x201c;Rich people always do. Before this stock market crashed, nobody saw it coming, except, of course, my wife, but that didn&#x2019;t help you, did it? See, I was hoarding cash. I was putting money in gold. While most Americans followed the leader&#x2013;blindly, stupidly followed the leader&#x2013;I was making money. In fact, Shawn, I was prospering while you were following the herd, losing almost everything, right, Shawn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fight!! Fight!! Fight!! Fight!!&#x201d; urges the crowd. Michaels looks hesitantly back and forth between the heaving crowd and Layfield.<br><br>&#x201c;You lost your 401(k). You lost your retirement. You lost your nest egg. You lost <i>your children&#x2019;s education fund</i>,&#x201d; Layfield bellows into the mic, his face inches from Michaels&#x2019;s. &#x201c;You got to support your extended family, Shawn, and now you look around with all this responsibility, and you look at your beautiful wife, she&#x2019;s a beautiful lady, you look at your two little wonderful kids, and you wonder: &#x2018;How in the world . . . am I going to send them . . . to college?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Layfield pauses heavily. Michaels&#x2019; face is slack, pained. Small, individual voices shout out from the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ve got an answer,&#x201d; Layfield goes on. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m offering you a job. I want you to come work&#x2013;for <i>me</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! No! No!&#x201d; yells the crowd. Michaels blinks slowly, dazed, and lowers his eyes to the mat.<br><br>&#x201c;See, there&#x2019;s always alternatives, Shawn. There&#x2019;s alternatives to everything. You can always wrestle until you&#x2019;re fifty. You might even wrestle till you&#x2019;re sixty. In fact, you could be a lot like these has-beens who are disgracing themselves in high school gyms all over the country, bragging about their war stories of selling the place out while they&#x2019;re hawking their eight-by-tens and selling Polaroids. Shawn, you could be that guy, or you could take my offer, because I promise you this: All the revenue that you&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; to make off your DX T-shirts will not compare to the offer that I . . . made . . . to you.&#x201d;<br><br>He tells the Heartbreak Kid to look in the mirror, adding, &#x201c;The years haven&#x2019;t been kind to you, have they, Shawn?&#x201d; He reminds him that one more bad fall, one more injury, and &#x201c;you&#x2019;re done, you&#x2019;re done.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd begins to rally their stunned hero, growing louder and louder. &#x201c;HBK! HBK! HBK!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What else can you really do besides this?&#x201d; Layfield asks. &#x201c;You get a second chance in life.&#x201d;<br><br>Layfield sweeps off his white Stetson. &#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; he screams into Michaels&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Ever since you walked out here . . . people have been wantin&#x2019; you to kick me in the face. So why don&#x2019;t you do it? I&#x2019;m gonna give you a free shot, Shawn, right here.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd erupts, roaring for the Heartbreak Kid to strike.<br><br>&#x201c;HBK!! DO IT!! DO IT!! HBK!! HBK!!!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen to &#x2019;em. Everybody wants it. Shawn, it&#x2019;s what you want. You&#x2019;re twitching. You&#x2019;re begging to pull the trigger, so I&#x2019;m telling you right now, take a shot! Take it!&#x201d;<br><br>The Heartbreak Kid takes one step back, his stubbled face trembling, breathing rapidly like a rabbit. The crowd is leaping out of their seats, thrusting their arms in the air, holding up handmade banners.<br><br>&#x201c;HBK!!! HBK!!! HBK!!!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do it, Shawn,&#x201d; Layfield hollers, &#x201c;before it&#x2019;s too late. This is your second chance, but understand this, understand this&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;HBK!!! HBK!!! HBK!!!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2013;Listen to me and not them! If you take this shot . . . then this offer is off the table . . . <i>forever</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd stops chanting. Different cries are heard: boos, shouts to attack, shouts to stop. There is no longer unity in the auditorium.<br><br>Layfield holds his head outstretched until the Heartbreak Kid slowly turns his back. Layfield leers. Shawn Michaels climbs through the ropes out of the ring and walks heavily back to the dressing room, his dull gaze on the ground.<br><br>&#x201c;Lookin&#x2019; forward to doin&#x2019; business with ya, Shawn,&#x201d; Layfield shouts after him.<br><br>The crowd screams.<br><br>Layfield, like most of the wrestlers, has a long, complicated fictional backstory that includes a host of highly publicized intrigues, fights, betrayals, infidelities, abuse, and outrageous behavior&#x2013;including goose-stepping around the ring and giving the Nazi salute during a wrestling bout in Germany. But tonight he has come in his newest incarnation as the &#x201c;self-made millionaire,&#x201d; the capitalist, the CEO who walked away with a pot of gold while workers across the country lost their jobs, saw their savings and retirement funds evaporate, and fought off foreclosure.<br><br>As often happens in a celebrity culture, the line between public and fictional personas blurs. Layfield actually claims to have made a fortune as a stock market investor and says he is married to the &#x201c;richest woman on Wall Street.&#x201d; He is a regular panelist on Fox News Channel&#x2019;s <i>The Cost of Freedom </i>and previously appeared on CNBC, not only as a celebrity wrestler but as a savvy investor whose conservative political views are worth airing. He also has written a best-selling book on financial planning called <i>Have More Money Now. </i>He hosts a weekend talk-radio program syndicated nationally by Talk Radio Network, in which he discusses politics.<br><br>The interaction between the crowd and Layfield is vintage professional wrestling. The twenty-minute bouts employ the same tired gimmicks, the same choreographed moves, the endless counts to two by the referee that never seem to get to three without the pinned wrestler leaping up from the mat to continue the fight. There is the desperate struggle of a prostrate wrestler trying to reach the hand of his or her partner to be relieved in the ring. This pantomime, with his opponent on his back and his arm outstretched, can go on for a couple of minutes. There are a lot of dirty shots when the referee is distracted&#x2013;which is often.<br><br>The bouts are stylized rituals. They are public expressions of pain and a fervent longing for revenge. The lurid and detailed sagas behind each bout, rather than the wrestling matches themselves, are what drive crowds to a frenzy. These ritualized battles give those packed in the arenas a temporary, heady release from mundane lives. The burden of real problems is transformed into fodder for a high-energy pantomime. And the most potent story tonight, the most potent story across North America, is one of financial ruin, desperation, and enslavement of a frightened and abused working class to a heartless, tyrannical, corporate employer. For most, it is only in the illusion of the ring that they are able to rise above their small stations in life and engage in a heroic battle to fight back.<br><br>As the wrestlers appear and strut down the aisle, the crowd, mostly young, working-class males, knows by heart the long list of vendettas and betrayals being carried into the ring. The matches are always acts of retribution for a host of elaborate and fictional wrongs. The narratives of emotional wreckage reflected in the wrestlers&#x2019; stage biographies mirror the emotional wreckage of the fans. This is the deep appeal of professional wrestling. It is the appeal of much of popular culture, from Jerry Springer to &#x201c;reality&#x201d; television to Oprah Winfrey. The narratives expose the anxiety that we will die and never be recognized or acclaimed, that we will never be wealthy, that we are not among the chosen but remain part of the vast, anonymous masses. The ringside sagas are designed to reassure us. They hold out the hope that we, humble and unsung as these celebrities once were, will eventually be blessed with grace and fortune.<br><br>The success of professional wrestling, like most of the entertainment that envelops our culture, lies not in fooling us that these stories are real. Rather, it succeeds because we ask to be fooled. We happily pay for the chance to suspend reality. The wrestlers, like all celebrities, become our vicarious selves. They do what we cannot. They rise up from humble origins into a supernatural world of tyrants, divas, and fierce opponents who are huge and rippling with muscles&#x2013;mythic in their size and power. They face momentous battles and epic struggles. They win great victories. They garner fame and vanquish their anonymity. And they return to befriend and confer some of their supernatural power on us. It is the stuff of classical myths, including the narrative of Jesus Christ. It is the yearning that life conform to a recognizable pattern and provide ultimate fulfillment before death.<br><br>&#x201c;For the truth is,&#x201d; wrote Jos� Ortega y Gasset, &#x201c;that life on the face of it is a chaos in which one finds oneself lost. The individual suspects as much but is terrified to encounter this frightening reality face to face, and so attempts to conceal it by drawing a curtain of fantasy over it, behind which he can make believe that everything is clear.&#x201d;<br><br>Clashes in the professional wrestling ring from the 1950s to the 1980s hinged on a different narrative. The battle against the evil of communism and crude, racial stereotypes stoked the crowd. The bouts, which my grandfather religiously watched on Saturday afternoons, were raw, unvarnished expressions of the prejudices of the white working class from which he came. They appealed to nationalism and a dislike and distrust of all who were racially, ethnically, or religiously different. During these matches, some of which I watched as a boy, there was usually some huge hulk of a man, known invariably as &#x201c;The Russian Bear,&#x201d; who would say things like &#x201c;Ve vill bury you.&#x201d; Nikolai Volkoff, who wrestled during these years under the name Boris Breznikoff, used to sing the Soviet National Anthem and wave the Soviet flag before matches to bait the crowd. He eventually teamed up with an Iranian-born wrestler, Hossein Khosrow Ali Vaziri, known as The Iron Sheik. In the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis, the Iron Sheik bragged in the ring about his devotion and friendship with Ayatollah Khomeini. The Iron Sheik was regularly pitted against a wrestler known as Sergeant Slaughter, All-American G. I. During the first Gulf War; the Iron Sheik reinvented himself, as often happens with wrestlers who shed one persona and name for another, as Colonel Mustafa, an Iraqi who was a close confidant of Saddam Hussein. In wrestling, villains were nearly always foreigners. They were people who wanted to destroy &#x201c;our way of life.&#x201d; They hated America. They spoke in strange accents and had swarthy skin.<br><br>But that hatred, once directed outward, has turned inward. Wrestling fans, whose numbers have been swelled by new immigrants and are no longer limited to the white working class, began to come in too many colors. The steady loss of manufacturing jobs and decline in social services meant that blue-collar workers&#x2013;people like my grandparents&#x2013;could no longer find jobs that provided a living wage, jobs with benefits, jobs that could support a family. The hulks of empty manufacturing centers began to dot the landscape, including the abandoned mills in Maine, where my family lived. The disparity between the elite, the rich, and the rest of the country grew obscenely. The growing class division and hopelessness triggered a mounting rage toward the elite, as well as a sense of powerlessness. Communities began to crumble. Downtown stores went out of business and were boarded up. Domestic abuse and drug and alcohol addiction began to plague working-class neighborhoods and towns.<br><br>The story line in professional wrestling evolved to fit the new era. It began to focus on the petty, cruel, psychological dramas and family dysfunction that come with social breakdown. The enemy became figures like Layfield, those who had everything and lorded it over those who did not. The anger unleashed by the crowd became the anger of people who, like the Heartbreak Kid, felt used, shamed, and trapped. It became the anger of class warfare. Figures such as Layfield&#x2013;who arrives at professional matches in a giant white limousine with Texan &#x201c;hook &#x2019;em&#x201d; horns on the hood&#x2013;are created by wrestling promoters to shove these social disparities in the faces of the audience, just as the Iron Sheik mocked the crowd with his hatred of America.<br><br>Wrestlers work in &#x201c;stables,&#x201d; or groups. These groups, all of which have managers, are at war with the other groups. This motif, too, is new. It represents a society that has less and less national cohesion, a society that has broken down into warlike and antagonistic tribes. The stables cheat, lie, steal one another&#x2019;s women, and ignore all rules in the desperate scramble to win. Winning is all that matters. Morality is irrelevant. These wrestling clans have their own logos, uniforms, slogans, theme songs, cheerleaders, and other badges of communal identity. They do not, however, stay consistent in their &#x201c;good guy&#x201d; or &#x201c;bad guy&#x201d; status. A clan, like an individual wrestler, can be good one week and evil the next.

Research suggests otherwise. Studies have provided two startling findings. First, most persons come for four or fewer counseling sessions, whatever the counseling method employed. Second, the majority of any counseling&#39;s effectiveness occurs in the opening few sessions. Part One uses brief pastoral counseling as a framework for detailing specific issues and approaches: getting the problem clear, assigning homework between sessions, and focusing on strengths. Part Two connects many of the typical problems encountered in parish ministry to specific counseling interventions which work in only a few sessions. Using many examples formulated out of Stone&#39;s years of counseling experience, it allows the reader to visualize each approach and make use of it as a counseling strategy.</p><p></p><h2>Stones of Aran: Pilgrimage</h2><p>Describes a journey around the coast of Aran along the southern cliff-line of the Atlantic, including the Western Brannock Islets, followed by a return around the low-lying northern coast.

He developed a reputation as an artistic hermit, committed to a highly personal vision of painting that combined myth, mysticism, history, and a fascination with the bizarre and exotic. Yet Moreau was also a prominent public figure in the Paris art world, winning praise for exhibits at the Salon, becoming a respected teacher at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and exerting a powerful influence on Henri Matisse, Georges Rouault, and the schools of Symbolism and Surrealism. This book, published to coincide with a spectacular international exhibition that marks the centenary of Moreau's death, presents a wide range of the artist's most famous and beautiful works along with penetrating essays and catalogue entries that explain his unique achievements in all their intellectual complexity and visual richness.</p><br><p>The volume reproduces and describes in detail more than 200 of Moreau's works, ranging from such well-known paintings as <i>Orpheus</i> and <i>The Apparition</i> (one of his many treatments of Salome and the beheaded John the Baptist) to lesser known but revealing watercolors, drawings, and sculptures. Two particularly important paintings--<i>Oedipus and the Sphinx</i> and <i>Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra</i>--are the focus of longer descriptions that cast light on Moreau's working methods. Genevi�ve Lacambre, Director of the Mus�e Gustave Moreau in Paris, introduces the volume and contributes an essay about Moreau's passionate interest in the "exoticism" of other cultures, particularly those of Persia and India. Marie-Laure de Contenson describes the artist's powerful attraction to medieval art and aesthetics. Larry Feinberg shows that Moreau was deeply influenced by the Italian Renaissance and, in particular, Leonardo and Michelangelo. Douglas Druick writes about Moreau's evocative symbolic language, which drew on unique reinterpretations of mythical figures and events to convey the artist's anxieties about the immorality and materialism of his age.</p><br><p>This is a powerfully written and visually stunning record of the creativity and exquisite craftsmanship of Moreau's distinctive contributions to nineteenth-century art.</p></p><p>Nineteenth-century French painter Gustave Moreau's (1826-1898) epic paintings, filled with rich imagery culled from mythology, history, and his own vivid imagination, are well known to today's art viewers. Yet this painter, who is still popular more than a century after his death and was a powerful member of the art world of his day, was in fact obsessively private about his artistic vision. Moreau's solitary pursuit of a painting style that he termed <i>peinture �pique</i> ("epic painting") stood in opposition to contemporary trends of academic naturalism and impressionism. The artist carefully researched the elements in each of his paintings, but was motivated too by a quest for "the infinite" in art--that which cannot be put into words, the sublime. His use of brilliant, jewel-like colors, sensitively rendered gestural drawing, and complex compositions helped him both to depict an ideal world and explore the salient issues of his times--morality and the foibles of earthly existence among them.<p> <i>Between Epic and Dream</i> was published in conjunction with the first full retrospective of Moreau's work, presented during the spring and summer of 1999 at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, after the centennial of his death. Three informative essays investigate the painter's interest in Indian and Persian culture as well as other historical eras such as the Middle Ages and the Italian Renaissance. A fourth essay examines Moreau's relationship to the symbolist movement, upon which his work would have a profound influence. At a substantial 308 pages, this stunning cloth-covered hardback displays over 200 of Moreau's masterpieces and lesser-known works in 162 color plates and 129 duotone images. <i>--A.C.

Jeff includes training schedules for beginners and veterans, information on nutrition, issues for the mature exerciser, motivation and recovery plus some new concepts: Magic Mile, shorter long runs between the really long weekend sessions. Includes a special chapter on Donna Hicken, breast cancer survivor and originator of the Breast Cancer Half Marathon &amp; Marathon (inaugural event on February 17, 2008) in Jacksonville, Florida.</p><p>Jeff was an average high school runner who learned, trained hard and made the US Olympic team in 1972. His most satisfying moment, however, was pacing his teammate, Jack Bacheler, through the Olympic Trials Marathon and dropping back at the finish line so that Jack could take the final qualifying spot on the team. Since then, the force of his life has been helping others to enjoy the experience of running and and walking and the achievement of finishing a challenging event. Jeff&#39;s specialty is maximizing the enjoyment and satisfaction of running and walking, while minimizing the time spent, the injuries and the fatigue. He keeps innovating and articulating techniques which help average people enjoy running and walking more, run faster and reduce injuries. In Jeff&#39;s training programs across North America, thousands of beginners finish a marathon six months after taking their first step. More important to Jeff is that most of these folks are hooked on fitness.

Locke stressed the teaching of rational thinking, moral dependability, and social grace in the classroom, with the aim of helping students to not only reflect but take action. <br>Locke's writings on education are enlightening reading for philosophy students, teachers, and for anyone interested in educational reform.</p><p>John W.

I was fully prepared to beg my father to be part of the act, but he asked, as if I were the one who would be doing him a favor.<br> <br>Like I said, I was six, and I still believed that my father truly could pull coins out of my ear and find a bouquet of flowers in the folds of Mrs. Kleban&#x2019;s chenille housecoat and make Mr. van Looen&#x2019;s false teeth disappear. He did these little tricks all the time for the elderly folks who came to play bingo or do chair aerobics or watch old black-and-white movies with soundtracks that crackled like flame. I knew some parts of the act were fake&#x2014;his fiddlehead mustache, for example, and the quarter with two heads&#x2014;but I was one hundred percent sure that his magic wand had the ability to transport me into some limbo zone, until he saw fit to call me back.<br> <br>On the night of the Christmas show, the residents of three different assisted-living communities in our town braved the cold and the snow to be bused to the senior center. They sat in a semicircle watching my father while I waited backstage. When he announced me&#x2014;the Amazing Cordelia!&#x2014;I stepped out wearing the sequined leotard I usually kept in my dress-up bin.<br> <br>I learned a lot that night. For example, that part of being the magician&#x2019;s assistant means coming face-to-face with illusion. That invisibility is really just knotting your body in a certain way and letting the black curtain fall over you. That people don&#x2019;t vanish into thin air; that when you can&#x2019;t find someone, it&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;ve been misdirected to look elsewhere.|Vanishing Acts Delia<p></p> <br>You can&#x2019;t exist in this world without leaving a piece of yourself behind. There are concrete paths, like credit card receipts and appointment calendars and promises you&#x2019;ve made to others. There are microscopic clues, like fingerprints, that stay invisible unless you know how to look for them. But even in the absence of any of this, there&#x2019;s scent. We live in a cloud that moves with us as we check e-mail and jog and carpool. The whole time, we shed skin cells&#x2014;forty thousand per minute&#x2014;that rise on currents up our legs and under our chins.<br> <br>Today, I&#x2019;m running behind Greta, who picks up the pace just as we hit the twisted growth at the base of the mountain. I&#x2019;m soaked to the thighs with muck and slush, although it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be bothering my bloodhound any. The awful conditions that make it so hard to navigate are the same conditions that have preserved this trail.<br> <br>The officer from the Carroll, New Hampshire, Police Department who is supposed to be accompanying me has fallen behind. He takes one look at the terrain Greta is bulldozing and shakes his head. &#x201c;Forget it,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way a four-year-old would have made it through this mess.&#x201d;<br> <br>The truth is, he&#x2019;s probably right. At this time of the afternoon, as the ground cools down under a setting sun, air currents run downslope, which means that although the girl probably walked through flatter area some distance away, Greta is picking up the scent trail where it&#x2019;s drifted. &#x201c;Greta disagrees,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>In my line of work, I can&#x2019;t afford not to trust my partner. Fifty percent of a dog&#x2019;s nose is devoted to the sense of smell, compared to only one square inch of mine. So if Greta says that Holly Gardiner wandered out of the playground at Sticks &amp; Stones Day Care and climbed to the top of Mount Deception, I&#x2019;m going to hike right up there to find her.<br> <br>Greta yanks on the end of the fifteen-foot leash and hustles at a clip for a few hundred feet. A beautiful bloodhound, she has a black widow&#x2019;s peak, a brown velvet coat, and the gawky body of the girl who watches the dancers from the bleachers. She circles a smooth, bald rock twice; then glances up at me, the folds of her long face deepening. Scent will pool, like the ripples when a stone&#x2019;s thrown into a pond. This is where the child stopped to rest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Find her,&#x201d; I order. Greta casts around to pick up the scent again, and then starts to run. I sprint after the dog, wincing as a branch snaps back against my face and opens a cut over my left eye. We tear through a snarl of vines and burst onto a narrow footpath that opens up into a clearing.<br> <br>The little girl is sitting on the wet ground, shivering, arms lashed tight over her knees. Just like always, for a moment her face is Sophie&#x2019;s, and I have to keep myself from grabbing her and scaring her half to death. Greta bounds over and jumps up, which is how she knows to identify the person whose scent she took from a fleece hat at the day-care center and followed six miles to this spot.<br> <br>The girl blinks up at us, slowly pecking her way through a shell of fear. &#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;re Holly,&#x201d; I say, crouching beside her. I shrug off my jacket, ripe with body heat, and settle it over her clothespin shoulders. &#x201c;My name is Delia.&#x201d; I whistle, and the dog comes trotting close. &#x201c;This is Greta.&#x201d;<br> <br>I slip off the harness she wears while she&#x2019;s working. Greta wags her tail so hard that it makes her body a metronome. As the little girl reaches up to pat the dog, I do a quick visual assessment. &#x201c;Are you hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>She shakes her head and glances at the cut over my eye. &#x201c;You are.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then the Carroll police officer bursts into the clearing, panting. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be damned,&#x201d; he wheezes. &#x201c;You actually found her.&#x201d;<br> <br>I always do. But it isn&#x2019;t my track record that keeps me in this business. It&#x2019;s not the adrenaline rush; it&#x2019;s not even the potential happy ending. It&#x2019;s because, when you get down to it, I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;s lost.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I watch the reunion between mother and daughter from a distance&#x2014;how Holly melts into her mother&#x2019;s arms, how relief binds them like a seam. Even if she&#x2019;d been a different race or dressed like a gypsy, I would have been able to pick this woman out of a crowd: She is the one who seems unraveled, half of a whole.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t imagine anything more terrifying than losing Sophie. When you&#x2019;re pregnant, you can think of nothing but having your own body to yourself again; yet after giving birth you realize that the biggest part of you is now somehow external, subject to all sorts of dangers and disappearance, so you spend the rest of your life trying to figure out how to keep her close enough for comfort. That&#x2019;s the strange thing about being a mother: Until you have a baby, you don&#x2019;t even realize how much you were missing one.<br> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if the subject Greta and I are searching for is old, young, male, or female&#x2014;to someone, that missing person is what Sophie is to me.<br> <br>Part of my tight connection to Sophie, I know, is pure over-compensation. My mother died when I was four. When I was Sophie&#x2019;s age, I&#x2019;d hear my father say things like &#x201c;I lost my wife in a car accident,&#x201d; and it made no sense to me: If he knew where she was, why didn&#x2019;t he just go find her? It took me a lifetime to realize things don&#x2019;t get lost if they don&#x2019;t have value&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t miss what you don&#x2019;t care about&#x2014;but I was too young to have stored up a cache of memories of my mother. For a long time, all I had of her was a smell&#x2014;a mixture of vanilla and apples could bring her back as if she were standing a foot away&#x2014;and then this disappeared, too. Not even Greta can find someone without that initial clue.<br> <br>From where she is sitting beside me, Greta nuzzles my forehead, reminding me that I&#x2019;m bleeding. I wonder if I&#x2019;ll need stitches, if this will launch my father into another tirade about why I should have become something relatively safer, like a bounty hunter or the leader of a bomb squad.<br> <br>Someone hands me a gauze pad, which I press against the cut above my eye. When I glance up I see it&#x2019;s Fitz, my best friend, who happens to be a reporter for the paper with the largest circulation in our state. &#x201c;What does the other guy look like?&#x201d; he asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got attacked by a tree.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No kidding? I always heard their bark is worse than their bite.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fitzwilliam MacMurray grew up in one of the houses beside mine; Eric Talcott lived in the other. My father used to call us Siamese triplets. I have a long history with both of them that includes drying slugs on the pavement with Morton&#x2019;s salt, dropping water balloons off the elementary school roof, and kidnapping the gym teacher&#x2019;s cat. As kids, we were a triumverate; as adults, we are still remarkably close. In fact, Fitz will be pulling double duty at my wedding&#x2014;as Eric&#x2019;s best man, and as my man-of-honor.<br> <br>From this angle, Fitz is enormous. He&#x2019;s six-four, with a shock of red hair that makes him look like he&#x2019;s on fire. &#x201c;I need a quote from you,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>I always knew Fitz would wind up writing; although I figured he&#x2019;d be a poet or a storyteller. He would play with language the way other children played with stones and twigs, building structures for the rest of us to decorate with our imagination. &#x201c;Make something up,&#x201d; I suggest.<br> <br>He laughs. &#x201c;Hey, I work for the New Hampshire Gazette, not the New York Times.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d;<br> <br>We both turn at the sound of a woman&#x2019;s voice. Holly Gardiner&#x2019;s mother is staring at me, her expression so full of words that, for a moment, she can&#x2019;t choose the right one. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she says finally. &#x201c;Thank you so much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank Greta,&#x201d; I reply. &#x201c;She did all the work.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman is on the verge of tears, the weight of the moment falling as heavy and sudden as rain. She grabs my hand and squeezes, a pulse of understanding between mothers, before she heads back to the rescue workers who are taking care of Holly.<br> <br>There were times I missed my mother desperately while I was growing up&#x2014;when all the other kids at school had two parents at the Holiday Concert, when I got my period and had to sit down on the lip of the bathtub with my father to read the directions on the Tampax box, when I first kissed Eric and felt like I might burst out of my skin.<br> <br>Now.<br> <br>Fitz slings his arm over my shoulders. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like you missed out,&#x201d; he says gently. &#x201c;Your dad was better than most parents put together.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I reply, but I watch Holly Gardiner and her mother walk all the way back to their car, hand in hand, like two jewels on a delicate strand that might at any moment be broken.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>That night Greta and I are the lead story on the evening news. In rural New Hampshire, we don&#x2019;t get broadcasts of gang wars and murders and serial rapists; instead, we get barns that burn down and ribbon-cuttings at local hospitals and local heroes like me.<br> <br>My father and I stand in the kitchen, getting dinner ready. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Sophie?&#x201d; I ask, frowning as I peer into the living room, where she lays puddled on the carpet.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s tired,&#x201d; my father says.<br> <br>She takes an occasional nap after I pick her up from kindergarten, but today, when I was on a search, my father had to bring her back to the senior center with him until closing time. Still, there&#x2019;s more to it. When I came home, she wasn&#x2019;t at the door waiting to tell me all the important things: who swung the highest at recess, which book Mrs. Easley read to them, whether snack was carrots and cheese cubes for the third day in a row.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you take her temperature?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it missing?&#x201d; He grins at me when I roll my eyes. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be her old self by dessert,&#x201d; he predicts. &#x201c;Kids bounce back fast.&#x201d;<br> <br>At nearly sixty, my father is good-looking&#x2014;ageless, almost, with his salt-and-pepper hair and runner&#x2019;s build. Although there were any number of women who would have thrown themselves at a man like Andrew Hopkins, he only dated sporadically, and he never remarried. He used to say that life was all about a boy finding the perfect girl; he was lucky enough to have been handed his in a labor and delivery room.<br> <br>He moves to the stove, adding half-and-half to the crushed tomatoes&#x2014;a homemade recipe trick one of the seniors taught him that turned out to be surprisingly good, unlike their tips for helping Sophie avoid croup (tie a black cord around her neck) or curing an earache (put olive oil and pepper on a cotton ball and stuff into the ear). &#x201c;When&#x2019;s Eric getting here?&#x201d; he asks. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep this cooking much longer.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was supposed to arrive a half hour ago, but there&#x2019;s been no phone call to say he&#x2019;s running late, and he isn&#x2019;t answering his cell. I don&#x2019;t know where he is, but there are plenty of places I am imagining him: Murphy&#x2019;s Bar on Main Street, Callahan&#x2019;s on North Park, off the road in a ditch somewhere.<br> <br>Sophie comes into the kitchen. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I say, my anxiety about Eric disappearing in the wide sunny wake of our daughter. &#x201c;Want to help?&#x201d; I hold up the green beans; she likes the crisp sound they make when they snap.<br> <br>She shrugs and sits down with her back against the refrigerator.<br> <br>&#x201c;How was school today?&#x201d; I prompt.<br> <br>Her small face darkens like the thunderstorms we get in July, sudden and fierce before they pass. Then, just as quickly, she looks up at me. &#x201c;Jennica has warts,&#x201d; Sophie announces.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s too bad,&#x201d; I reply, trying to remember which one Jennica is&#x2014;the classmate with the platinum braids, or the one whose father owns the gourmet coffee shop in town.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want warts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Headlights flash past the window, but don&#x2019;t turn into our driveway. I focus on Sophie, trying to remember if warts are contagious or if that&#x2019;s an old wives&#x2019; tale.<br> <br>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;re green,&#x201d; Sophie whines. &#x201c;And really soft and on the tag it says the name.&#x201d;<br> <br>Warts, apparently, is the hot new Beanie Baby. &#x201c;Maybe for your birthday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;ll forget that, too,&#x201d; Sophie accuses, and she runs out of the kitchen and upstairs.<br> <br>All of a sudden I can see the red circle on my calendar&#x2014;the parent-child tea in her kindergarten class started at one o&#x2019;clock, when I was halfway up a mountain searching for Holly Gardiner.<br> <br>When I was a kid and there was a mother-daughter event in my elementary school, I wouldn&#x2019;t tell my father about it. Instead, I&#x2019;d fake sick, staying home for the day so that I didn&#x2019;t have to watch everyone else&#x2019;s mother come through the door and know that my own was never going to arrive.<br> <br>I find Sophie lying on her bed. &#x201c;Baby,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looks up at me. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re with them,&#x201d; she asks, a slice through the heart, &#x201c;do you ever think about me?&#x201d;<br> <br>In response I pick her up and settle her on my lap. &#x201c;I think about you even when I&#x2019;m sleeping,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>It is hard to believe now, with this small body dovetailing against mine, but when I found out I was pregnant I considered not keeping the baby. I wasn&#x2019;t married, and Eric was having enough trouble without tossing in any added responsibility. In the end, though, I couldn&#x2019;t go through with it. I wanted to be the kind of mother who couldn&#x2019;t be separated from a child without putting up a fierce fight. I like to believe my own mother had been that way.<br> <br>Parenting Sophie&#x2014;with and without Eric, depending on the year&#x2014;has been much harder than I ever expected. Whatever I do right I chalk up to my father&#x2019;s example. Whatever I do wrong I blame squarely on fate.<br> <br>The door to the bedroom opens, and Eric walks in. For that half second, before all the memories crowd in, he takes my breath away. Sophie has my dark hair and freckles, but thankfully, that&#x2019;s about all. She&#x2019;s got Eric&#x2019;s lean build and his high cheekbones, his easy smile and his unsettling eye...</p><h2>Campaign 118: The Yom Kippur War 1973 (1) The Golan Heights</h2><p>Osprey's first title in the study of the Yom Kippur War (1973). At 1345hrs on 6 October 1973, Israeli spotters in the observation post atop Mount Hermon saw Syrian gunners below them removing the camouflage nets from their guns. Ten minutes later shells began to rain down on Israeli positions all along the Golan Heights &#x2013; The Yom Kippur War had begun. The shock Syrian attack caught the Israelis by surprise and by the afternoon of 7 October a Syrian brigade was less than 10km from the Sea of Galilee.

Milarepa was an eleventh-century Buddhist poet and saint, a cotton-clad yogi who avoided the scholarly institutions of his time and wandered from village to village, teaching enlightenment and the path to Buddhahood through his spontaneously composed songs. Wherever he went, crowds of people gathered to hear his sweet sounding voice "singing the Dharma." <br><br> <i>The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa, </i> says the book's translator, "has been read as the biography of a saint, a guide book for devotions, a manual of Buddhist yoga, a volume of songs and poems, and even a collection of Tibetan folklore, and fairy tales." With titles like "The Salvation of the Dead," "A Woman's Role in the Dharma," and "Challenge from a Wise Demoness," Milrepa's poems are filled with fascinating tales of miraculous encounters and colorful imagery, and present a valuable insight into the living quality of Tibetan Buddhism. Central as this book is to Tibetan culture, the arcane dialect and obscurity of many original passages daunted translators for centuries; this was the first complete version of the classic to appear in the West.</p><p>The translator, Garma C. C. Chang, traveled extensively in Tibet and studied Buddhism in several monasteries there for more than eight years. His translation of&nbsp;<i>The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa&nbsp;</i>is the fruit of many years of extensive study.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Tibetan</p><h2>Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men</h2><p><p>The passage from adolescence to adulthood was once clear. Today, growing up has become more complex and confusing, as young men drift casually through college and beyond&#x2014;hanging out, partying, playing with tech toys, watching sports. But beneath the appearance of a simple extended boyhood, a more dangerous social world has developed, far away from the traditional signposts and cultural signals that once helped boys navigate their way to manhood&#x2014;a territory Michael Kimmel has identified as "Guyland."</p> <p>In mapping the troubling social world where men are now made, Kimmel offers a view into the minds and times of America's sons, brothers, and boyfriends, and he works toward redefining what it means to be a man today&#x2014;and tomorrow.

Before the 1830s and Horace Mann, no schools in the U.S. were state supported or state controlled. They were local, parent-teacher enterprises, supported without taxes, and taking care of all children. They were remarkably high in standard and were Christian. From Mann to the present, the state has used education to socialize the child. The school&#39;s basic purpose, according to its own philosophers, is not education in the traditional sense of the 3 R&#39;s. Instead, it is to promote &#39;democracy&#39; and &#39;equality,&#39; not in their legal or civic sense, but in terms of the engineering of a socialized citizenry. Public education became the means of creating a social order of the educator&#39;s design. Such men saw themselves and the school in messianic terms. This book was instrumental in launching the Christian school and homeschool movements.</p><p></p><h2>Addy&#39;s Short Story Collection</h2><p>Five short stories starring the African American girl Addy are followed by brief actual accounts of what life was like for African Americans after the Civil War ended.</p><p></p><h2>All About Aussies: The Australian Shepherd From A To Z</h2><p>The definitive guide to the Australian Shepherd dog.

He attended University in Aberdeen in 1840 and then went on to Highbury College in 1848 where he studied to be a Congregational Minister, receiving his M. A. His first appointment was in Arundel, but he was forced to resign form the position in 1853. He became a lecturer in English Literature at Kings College in London before finally focusing all of his attention on writing and living off the charity of friends and pupils. In 1955, MacDonald wrote his first important original work, a long religious poem entitled &#34;Within and Without.&#34; Three years later in 1858, he wrote &#34;Phantastes,&#34; his first contribution to the fantasy genre. It was influenced by both the English and Germanic Romantic writers and religious poets of the Renaissance. MacDonald is perhaps best known for his fantasy children&#39;s books, although he wrote fantasy books for adults as well. His most well known children&#39;s book is &#34;At the Back of the North Wind,&#34; which was surprisingly a favorite of Mark Twain&#39;s children. In 1863, MacDonald published &#34;David Eiginbrod, the first of a dozen novels that were set in Scotland and based on the lives of rural Scots. It was these series of novels that gained MacDonald worldwide fame and brought money to the foundering MacDonald family. MacDonald was a friend and confident of Lewis Carroll and John Ruskin. He exchanged letters with Mark Twain, and met Walt Whitman and many other American writers on his trips to America. MacDonald also inspired his later compatriots, such as C. S. Lewis, with his blend of fantasy and Christianity. George MacDonald died in Ashtead, Surrey, England, on September 18. 1905. His body is buried in Bordighea, Italy, a place he spent most of his later years in.</p><h2>Bach&#39;s Goldberg Variations</h2><p>Johann Gottlieb Goldberg is a young servant in the employ of Count Keyserlingk. A talented musician, the boy secretly practices playing the harpsichord at night. When the count discovers Goldberg one evening, he challenges Goldberg to combine all the harpsichord music he&#39;s learned--and to throw in a riddle. In a panic, Goldberg turns to Johann Sebastian Bach for the perfect piece of music to appease the count. Stylized illustrations include elements from the baroque period. For families, teachers, and curious music lovers of all ages.</p><p><p> When we think about classical music, the names of great composers often come to mind. But music history is as much about performers and listeners as it is about composers. The characters in this story really did exist. Count Keyserlingk, a Russian ambassador living in Dresden, first came in contact with Johann Gottlieb Goldberg (1727-1756) in 1737; he was so amazed by the boy&#x2019;s talent that he offered him a position at court, where he was allowed to take music lessons with both Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach.<br><br>J. S. Bach&#x2019;s first biographer, Johann Nikolaus Forkel, reported that in the early 1740s Count Keyserlingk became ill and suffered sleepless nights. During these bouts of insomnia, Goldberg was often called upon to entertain the count with music. Scholars do not know the precise historical circumstances surrounding Goldberg&#x2019;s acquisition of Bach&#x2019;s composition. Some believe Count Keyserlingk commissioned the work; others propose that Bach gave the piece to Goldberg directly. Whatever the circumstances, it is known that Bach visited the count in Dresden in 1741 and that shortly thereafter Goldberg began playing the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> for Count Keyserlingk and his friends.<br><br>The <i>Goldberg Variations</i> is unlike any other piece written by Bach. It is monumental in scope, extremely difficult to play, and unusual for its extended use of repetition. The theme and thirty variations present an assortment of musical styles: some variations are inspired by dance pieces or orchestral genres, while others take the form of a canon or fugue. The final variation, the musical riddle, is a genre called a quodlibet, which means &#x201c;whatever you please&#x201d; in Latin. It&#x2019;s a humorous collection of various tunes played at once.<br><br>Today, some performers play the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> on piano. But it was originally composed for the harpsichord, as the piano had not yet been invented. The harpsichord resembles the piano in appearance, but it produces quite a different sound. Whereas the piano&#x2019;s sound is created by small hammers hitting the strings, the harpsichord&#x2019;s sound is created by small hooks or quills that pluck the strings.<br><br>When Bach published his impressive set of variations in 1742, he called them <i>A Keyboard Practice Consisting of an Aria with Thirty Variations for the Harpsichord</i>. Given the length of this title, we can see why the count&#x2019;s name for the piece, the <i>Goldberg Variations</i>, stuck more than 250 years ago and still remains popular today.<br><br>&#x2015; <i>Anna Harwell Celenza</i></p> <p></p>Anna Harwell Celenza is a musicologist and the author of several books for adults and children regarding music history and the history of art.

Alan Williams offers a unique synthesis of history, biography, aesthetics and film theory. He brings to life all of the major directors, setting before us the cultures from which they emerged, and sheds new light on the landmark films they created. He distills what is historically and artistically unique in each of their careers and reveals what each artist has in common with the forebears and heirs of the craft.</p><p>Within the larger story of French cinema, Williams examines the treasury of personal expression, social commentary, and aesthetic exploration that France has produced so consistently and exported so well. It is the tale of an industry rife with crises, and Williams offers a superb narrative of the economic, political, and social forces that have shaped its century-long history. He provides biographical sketches of filmmakers from the early pioneers of the silent era such as Louis Lumi�re and Alice Guy to modern directors such as Louis Malle, Claude Chabrol, and Fran�ois Truffaut. Some of their careers, he shows, exemplify the significant contributions individuals made to the development of French fllmmaking; others yield illuminating evidence of the problems and opportunities of a whole generation of filmmakers. Throughout, he presents critical analyses of significant films, from <i>The Assassination of the Duc de Guise</i> (1908) to works by the post&#x2013;<i>nouvelle vague</i> directors.</p><p>Williams captures the formal and stylistic developments of film in France over nearly one hundred years. Free of cant and jargon, <i>Republic of Images</i> is the best general account available of the rich interplay of film, filmmaker, and society. It will delight both general reader and student, as well as the viewer en route to the video store.</p></p><p>To tell the story of this small but highly visible and influential sector of French cinema requires also to tell the larger story of the industry which allowed-in fact, encouraged- its creation. And so this book includes a great deal of information on French film production in general, particularly at the moments of economic and moral crisis which seem to scan its history, like a strange rhyme scheme, every decade or decade and a half.&#x201c;The history of French cinema is the history of cinema.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nestor Almendros</b></p><h2>The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications 2013 Hardcover</h2><p>The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications is widely recongnized as being the standard reference among radio amateurs and other technologists-experimenter, engineers and students.

Reissue.</p><p>Lisa Jackson has been writing romantic fiction for fifteen years. Over sixty of her books have been published and reprinted in more than a dozen foreign languages. A single mother, she is a native of Oregon, where she still resides with her two teenage sons. Lisa is often asked what is the key to her success, and her unfailing answer is a keen imagination, incredible friends, loving family, and always, loads of laughter. As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said, &#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;In a letter to readers, Jackson (Cold Blooded, etc.) declares this a "spanking brand new edition" of her 1999 romantic suspense novel, complete with new twists and a new ending. As such, it should generate plenty of excitement among her fans, but new readers may be put off by the book's overabundance of sex and violence. After being approached to run for Governor of Oregon, Dutch Holland vows to lay the skeletons of his past to rest. He soon learns, however, that they won't go away so easily. Sixteen years earlier, his rival's younger son, Harley Taggert, was murdered, and Dutch believes one of his own daughters may have been responsible. Now, journalist Kane Moran has returned home to crack open the case and write a book about it, despite the fact that his actions may hurt his old crush, single mom Claire Holland, Dutch's daughter. Harley's brother, Weston Taggert, a typical animal-abusing sexual deviant, also hates Dutch and would do anything to discredit the Hollands. The relationship between Kane, a lowborn, abused bad boy, and the unreachable, well-off Claire follows a familiar path, but the pages practically sizzle when they're together. Stock secondary characters and predictable family dramas leech away some of the suspense, but Jackson livens up her story with a final, dizzying twist. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Little Daylight: A Fairy Story</h2><p>At her christening, the princess, Little Daylight, receives a curse from a wicked fairy that she shall never see the sun until kissed by a prince.</p><p>Michael Phillips has written four dozen books, most of them novels, with sales totaling over five million copies. He also has edited George MacDonald novels for today's reader, including, The Curate of Glaston. He and his wife make their home in Eureka, California.<br><br>Dorothee Duntze was born in Reims, France. She studied art at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Reims and the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs in Strasbourg. Among the other books she has illustrated for North-South are The Emperor's New Clothes, The Princess and the Pea, and Hansel and Gretel.Grade 2-4Little Daylight is Sleeping Beauty in Victorian guise, with the old story expanded with newly invented detail and the archetypical characters given a measure of individuality. MacDonald's principal change, however, is in the nature of the curse: instead of sleeping 100 years, Little Daylight must sleep when the sun is in the sky. Worse yet, she is ruled by the phases of the moon; young and beautiful when it is full, she ages with its waning. While this embroidered version sacrifices some of the dramatic tension of the original, there is compensation in the haunting nature of the curse and the formidable barrier it presents to a prince's required kiss. There are barriers, too, to an easy assignment of age or interest level for the book. Although adapted, the text retains much of MacDonald's rich style, putting it somewhat at odds with the picture book format in which it is set. Like the text, the full-color acrylic paintings on every page also depart from tradition. In place of generic princesses and fairies, Ingraham's characters reflect the crisp individuality of photographs, although they move in enchanted settings. This will be best used as a read-aloud to primary grade children, who will be moved by the ``Lost Horizon'' poignancy of the tale whether or not they understand every word. Janet D.

His mission is to bring the planet back into the fold of an evolving galactic civilization, but to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own culture and prejudices and those that he encounters. On a planet where people are of no gender--or both--this is a broad gulf indeed. The inventiveness and delicacy with which Le Guin portrays her alien world are not only unusual and inspiring, they are fundamental to almost all decent science fiction that has been written since. In fact, reading Le Guin again may cause the eye to narrow somewhat disapprovingly at the younger generation: what new ground are they breaking that is not already explored here with greater skill and acumen? It cannot be said, however, that this is a rollicking good story. Le Guin takes a lot of time to explore her characters, the world of her creation, and the philosophical themes that arise.<p> If there were a canon of classic science fiction, <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> would be included without debate. Certainly, no science fiction bookshelf may be said to be complete without it. But the real question: is it fun to read? It is science fiction of an earlier time, a time that has not worn particularly well in the genre. <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> was a groundbreaking book in 1969, a time when, like the rest of the arts, science fiction was awakening to new dimensions in both society and literature. But the first excursions out of the pulp tradition are sometimes difficult to reread with much enjoyment. Rereading <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, decades after its publication, one feels that those who chose it for the Hugo and Nebula awards were right to do so, for it truly does stand out as one of the great books of that era. It is immensely rich in timeless wisdom and insight.</p><p> <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> is science fiction for the thinking reader, and should be read attentively in order to properly savor the depth of insight and the subtleties of plot and character. It is one of those pleasures that requires a little investment at the beginning, but pays back tenfold with the joy of raw imagination that resonates through the subsequent 30 years of science fiction storytelling. Not only is the bookshelf incomplete without owning it, so is the reader without having read it. <i>--L.

It can also appear an extremely harsh and unforgiving environment, demanding to all who venture there. It is both those things, but it can also be magical. </p><p> This book is a celebration of the Arctic. It deals primarily with its wildlife, but a discussion of birds and mammals cannot restrict itself solely to identification, diet and breeding biology; it must also consider the wider picture. It cannot ignore the geology, the geography and the climate that define the habitat in which those animals and birds live. It cannot ignore the threats currently faced by the region, such as climate change, and the probable outcome for the wildlife if those threats are ignored. </p><p> The book starts by defining the Arctic and by considering how animals and plants have evolved to cope with the tough Arctic environment. The adaptations of these creatures are discussed, as are the ways their evolution has been driven by the ebb and flow of polar ice. Next the book moves on to look at the human history of the area, followed by a discussion of the threats posed to the Arctic and its wildlife by human activity. </p><p> Following the extensive field guide to the bird and mammal species, there is a visitor's guide to the Arctic, which looks in brief at what each region has to offer the wildlife observer, and the ease of travel to it. </p><p> Richard Sale, June 2006 </p></p><h2>The Friend We Have Not Met: Poems of Consolation</h2><p>An illustrated collection of poems offers understanding and consolation for those who have lost a loved one</p><p></p><h2>Stormy Persuasion: A Malory Novel (11) (Malory-Anderson Family)</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Johanna Lindsey returns to the dazzlingly passionate world of the Malorys, an aristocratic family of rakehell adventurers and spirited ladies, in a thrilling new tale of unbridled desires. </b><b> </b><br><br>Judith and Jacqueline Malory are not simply cousins; they are inseparable best friends.

And every time their mothers brought them to visit their cousins Brandon and Cheryl at the duke&#x2019;s ancestral estate in Hampshire, they&#x2019;d spend hours at this window hoping to see a light glowing eerily in the ruins again. The night they&#x2019;d first seen it had been so exciting, they couldn&#x2019;t help themselves.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d only seen the light on two other occasions since then. But by the time they&#x2019;d grabbed lanterns and run across the extensive lawn to reach the old, abandoned house on the neighboring property, the light had been gone.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d had to tell their cousin Brandon Malory about it, of course. He was a year younger than they were, but it was his home they were visiting, after all. The Duke of Wrighton&#x2019;s title and estate had passed to him through his mother, Kelsey, who had married the girls&#x2019; cousin Derek. His parents had elected to move into it when Brandon was born, so he would grow up aware of his stature and consequence. Luckily, being a duke hadn&#x2019;t spoiled him rotten.<br> <br>But Brandon had never actually seen the light himself, so he wasn&#x2019;t the least bit interested in the vigil tonight or any other night. He was currently on the other side of the room engrossed in teaching Judith&#x2019;s younger sister, Jaime, to play whist. Besides, having just turned seventeen, Brandon looked more like a man than a boy, and not surprisingly, he was now much more interested in girls than ghosts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Am I old enough now to be told the Secret?&#x201d; Brandon&#x2019;s younger sister, Cheryl, asked from the open doorway to her cousins&#x2019; room.<br> <br>Jaime Malory leapt up from the little card table and ran over to Cheryl, grabbing her hand and pulling her forward before turning to her older sister, Judith. &#x201c;She is. I was her age when you told me.&#x201d;<br> <br>But it was Jacqueline who answered, scoffing at her younger cousin, &#x201c;That was just last year, puss. And unlike you, Cheryl actually lives here. Tell her, Brand. She&#x2019;s your sister. She&#x2019;d have to promise never to go investigating on her own and you&#x2019;d have to make sure she keeps the promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Investigate?&#x201d; Cheryl looked at her two older cousins, who&#x2019;d been refusing for years to tell her their secret. &#x201c;How can I make a promise if I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m promising?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is no time for logic, puss,&#x201d; Judith said, concurring with Jacqueline. &#x201c;Promise first. Jaime had to, and she doesn&#x2019;t even live here. But you do, and without the promise, we&#x2019;d end up worrying about you. You don&#x2019;t want that, d&#x2019;you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl gave that a moment&#x2019;s thought before she shook her head. &#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith nudged Jacqueline to do the honors, and Jack didn&#x2019;t disappoint, saying baldly, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a ghost for a neighbor. He lives next door.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl burst into giggles but stopped when she noticed Judy and Jack weren&#x2019;t laughing. Wide-eyed, she asked, &#x201c;Really? You&#x2019;ve seen it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About five years ago, we did,&#x201d; Judith said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Judy even spoke to it,&#x201d; Jacqueline added.<br> <br>&#x201c;But Jack saw the light first, from this very window. So we just had to go have a look. We&#x2019;d always thought that old house must be haunted. And we were right!&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl walked forward slowly and joined them at the window to take a quick peek at the old eyesore her parents had complained about more&#x2019;n once. She let out a relieved breath when she didn&#x2019;t see any light. She wasn&#x2019;t nearly as brave as her cousins were. But in the moonlight she could see a clear outline of the large, old manor house that had fallen to ruin long before any of them were born, a big, dark, scary outline. With a shudder, she turned and hurried over to her brother for protection.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t actually go inside that house, did you?&#x201d; Cheryl asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course we did,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve all been warned not to!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only because it&#x2019;s dangerous with so many broken floorboards, crumbling walls, and a lot of the roof caved in. And cobwebs. There&#x2019;s cobwebs everywhere. It took Judy and me forever to get them out of our hair that night.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eyes flaring a little wider, Cheryl said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you actually went inside, and at night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, how else were we to find out who was trespassing? We didn&#x2019;t know it was a ghost yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You should have just told my father you saw the light,&#x201d; Cheryl said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s no fun,&#x201d; Jack pointed out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fun? You don&#x2019;t need to pretend to be so courageous just because your fathers are.&#x201d; When the two older girls started laughing, Cheryl said, &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re just pulling my leg? I should have known!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jacqueline grinned at her. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you really think we&#x2019;d keep the Secret from you all these years just to pull your leg? You wanted to know and now we&#x2019;re finally telling you. It was incredibly exciting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And only a little frightening,&#x201d; Judith added.<br> <br>&#x201c;And foolhardy,&#x201d; Cheryl insisted.<br> <br>Jack snorted. &#x201c;If we let things like that stop us, we&#x2019;d have no fun a&#x2019;tall. And we had weapons. I grabbed a shovel from the garden.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I took my scissors along,&#x201d; Judith added.<br> <br>Cheryl had always wished she was as brave as these two. Now she was glad she wasn&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;d thought they&#x2019;d find a vagrant, but they&#x2019;d found a ghost instead. It was a wonder their hair hadn&#x2019;t turned white that night, but Judy&#x2019;s gold hair was still streaked with copper, not gray, and Jack was still as blond as her father was.<br> <br>&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t tell where the light was coming from when we stepped inside the house that night,&#x201d; Jack was saying. &#x201c;So we split up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I found him first,&#x201d; Judy said, continuing the story. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not even sure which room he was in. I didn&#x2019;t notice the light until I opened a door. And there he was, floating in the middle of the room. And none too pleased to see me. I promptly told him he was trespassing. He told me I was the trespasser, that the house was his. I told him ghosts can&#x2019;t own houses. He just stretched his arm out, pointing behind me, and told me to get out. He was a bit harsh. He seemed to growl at me so I did turn about to leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s when I arrived,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;Only to see his back as he floated away. I asked him to wait, but he didn&#x2019;t. He just bellowed, &#x2018;Get out, both of you!&#x2019;&#x2014;so loud it shook the rafters, or what&#x2019;s left of them. We did, ran right out of there. But we were only halfway back to the mansion when we realized he couldn&#x2019;t really hurt us. And we were missing the opportunity to help him move on. So we went back and searched every room, but he&#x2019;d already faded away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You wanted to help him?&#x201d; Cheryl asked incredulously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Judy did.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl stared at the slightly older of the two cousins. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith shrugged evasively, saying, &#x201c;He was a handsome young man. Must&#x2019;ve been only twenty or so when he died. And he seemed so sad when I first spotted him, before he noticed me and got belligerent and protective of his crumbling ruin of a house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And because she fell in love with a ghost that night,&#x201d; Jack added with a snicker.<br> <br>Judith gasped. &#x201c;I did not!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You did!&#x201d; Jack teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d just like to know what caused him to become a ghost. It must have been something quite tragic and frightening, if his hair turned white before he died.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;White hair?&#x201d; Cheryl said with owlish eyes. &#x201c;Then he must be old.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly, puss,&#x201d; Jacqueline admonished. &#x201c;My sister-in-law Danny has white hair, doesn&#x2019;t she? And she was as young as we are now when she met Jeremy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; Cheryl allowed, then asked Judith, &#x201c;Was he really handsome then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very, and tall, and with lovely dark green eyes that glowed like emeralds&#x2014;and don&#x2019;t you dare go looking for him without us,&#x201d; Judy added, sounding almost jealous.<br> <br>Cheryl huffed, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not daring or curious like you two. I have no desire to meet a ghost, thank you very much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good, because he seems to have magical powers, too, or haven&#x2019;t you noticed that the roof&#x2019;s been repaired?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheryl gasped. &#x201c;By a ghost?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who else?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t notice. My room&#x2019;s on the other side of the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I noticed,&#x201d; Brandon spoke up. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve never seen workers there to account for it, but the roof has definitely been repaired recently.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you didn&#x2019;t point that out to your father?&#x201d; Jacqueline said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, if I did, I&#x2019;d have to tell him the Secret, and I&#x2019;m not breaking the promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jacqueline beamed at him. &#x201c;I knew we could count on you, Brand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides, Father grumbles anytime someone mentions that old place. He&#x2019;s annoyed that he can&#x2019;t get rid of it. He&#x2019;s tried to buy it so he could tear it down, but the last owner of record was a woman named Mildred Winstock, and she merely inherited it, she never lived in it. And no wonder, with a ghost in residence. It&#x2019;s actually been empty since my great-great-grandfather&#x2019;s day, which would explain its crumbling condition. But then I told you why he built it and who he gave it to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Cheryl asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not for your young ears,&#x201d; Brandon replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;His mistress?&#x201d; Cheryl guessed.<br> <br>Judith rolled her eyes at her precocious cousin and changed the subject. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing this place didn&#x2019;t fall to ruin, too, being empty for five generations as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not quite empty,&#x201d; Brandon replied. &#x201c;The ducal estate has paid to maintain a minimal staff here to keep that from happening. But Father could find no record of who Miss Winstock left the ruin to when she died, so we&#x2019;re stuck with it mucking up our backyard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek had planted trees and thick shrubbery along the property line, though, to block the crumbling, old house from view so people could enjoy the ducal gardens without having to look at that eyesore. But the trees didn&#x2019;t block the view of the old house from the upper floors of the ducal mansion.<br> <br>Judith sighed as she moved away from the window. &#x201c;All right, Cousins, time for Judy and me to get to bed, so you probably should, too. We return to London in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>As soon as their cousins left the room, Jacqueline said, &#x201c;What did you expect? They haven&#x2019;t seen the ghost like we have.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith sighed. &#x201c;Oh, Cheryl&#x2019;s lack of an adventurous nature doesn&#x2019;t surprise me. Derek and Kelsey keep her too sheltered here, while you and I&#x2019;ve grown up in London.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, so that sigh was because we didn&#x2019;t see the light on this visit? We can go search through the ruin tonight if you&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, the ghost only revealed himself to us once. I&#x2019;m quite sure he hides now when we invade his domain. More&#x2019;s the pity,&#x201d; Judith said with another sigh.<br> <br>Jacqueline threw a pillow at her. &#x201c;Stop mooning over a ghost. You do realize he&#x2019;s not the marrying sort?&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith burst out laughing. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;ve had no trouble figuring that out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good, because it&#x2019;d be quite difficult to get a kiss out of him, much less a nice tumble.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith raised a brow. &#x201c;Tumble? I thought you scratched being a rake off your list last year?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bite your tongue. I&#x2019;m just going to take a leaf from our cousin Amy&#x2019;s book and not take no for an answer&#x2014;when I find the chap for me. And when I do, heaven help him. The man won&#x2019;t know what hit him,&#x201d; Jacqueline added with a roguish grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t find him too soon. And do not find him in America.&#x201d;<br> <br>There it was again, Jacqueline&#x2019;s voyage looming in front of them. The first time Jacqueline had sailed off to America with her parents, Judith had been distraught and inconsolable the entire two months of Jack&#x2019;s absence. The girls had sworn then never to be more&#x2019;n a carriage ride away from each other ever again, so Judy got to go along the second time Jack visited America. But the girls hadn&#x2019;t known at the time about the promise James Malory had made to the Anderson brothers when Jack was born. Her American uncles had agreed that Jacqueline could be raised exclusively in England as long as she had her come-out in America, because they hoped she&#x2019;d marry an American. At least be given the chance to.<br> <br>When asked why he would agree to something so out of character for him, James had said, &#x201c;It kept me from having to kill them, which would have made George quite annoyed with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>True, they were George&#x2019;s brothers, after all, and James hadn&#x2019;t actually been joking, either, about killing them. George was Jacqueline&#x2019;s mother, Georgina to be exact, but James insisted on calling his wife George because he knew her brothers would hate it, but truth be known, even her five older brothers called her that now on occasion. But that promise James had made had kept an unspoken truce in effect all these years with his five American brothers-in-law. Which had been needed, considering they&#x2019;d once tried to hang James Malory.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to marry until you do,&#x201d; Jacqueline assured her cousin, &#x201c;so don&#x2019;t you be in a hurry to either. We don&#x2019;t need to be following the pack and getting married our first Season, even if our mothers are expecting us to. This year is for fun, next year can be for marriage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not going to stop you from sailing off without me,&#x201d; Judith said forlornly.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but we still have a couple of weeks to come up with a solution. We&#x2019;ll talk to our parents as soon as we get back to London. It&#x2019;s your parents that have to be convinced. My father would be glad to have you along, but when Uncle Tony said no, Father had to side with him. Brothers, you know, and those two in particular, always stick together. But if I tell them that I won&#x2019;t go to America if you can&#x2019;t come with me, they&#x2019;ll see reason. And why did your father say no? It&#x2019;s not as if he&#x2019;s looking forward to your come-out. He&#x2019;s been a veritable ogre with it approaching.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judith giggled. &#x201c;My father is never an ogre. A bit terse and snappish lately, yes, but&#x2014;you&#x2019;re right, he&#x2019;d be quite happy if I never marry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly, so he should have jumped at the chance to send you off with me, prolonging the inevitable.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But is marriage inevitable, with fathers like ours?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jacqueline laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking of Cousin Regina&#x2019;s being raised by the four Malory elders after their sis...</p><h2>Garfield Weighs His Options: His 49th Book</h2><p><b>The perfect holiday gift for fans of the tubby tabby!</b><br><br>TO EAT, OR NOT TO EAT?<br><br>That's a stupid question!

Set during the pioneer days of the late 1800s and early 1900s, Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s books chronicle her life growing up on the Western frontier.</p><p>Although the Little House stories are traditionally seen as "girl" books, boys might be happily surprised if they take another peek at their sisters' shelves. <i>Little House in the Big Woods</i>--the first book of the series and Laura Ingalls Wilder's first children's book--is full of the thrills, chills, and spills typically associated with "boy" books. Any boy or girl who has fantasized about running off to live in the woods will find ample information in these pages to manage a Wisconsin snowstorm, a panther attack, or a wild sled ride with a pig as an uninvited guest. Every chapter divulges fascinatingly intricate, yet easy-to-read, details about pioneer life in the Midwest in the late 1800s, from bear-meat curing to maple-tree sapping to homemade bullet making. <p> Wilder's autobiographical tales ring with truth and excitement. Readers will receive a perfectly painless history lesson, and in fact will clamor for more. Beloved illustrator Garth Williams spent years researching young Laura's pioneering family. His soft-line illustrations bring to life the full, simple days and nights in the family's log cabin. No one can read just one Little House book!

If the traditional narrative version of The Lost Hero (Disney-Hyperion, 2010) hit the ground running, it is nothing compared to what awaits readers in a sequential art format. It takes fewer than 10 pages for the story to start with a [quite literal] bang, and it relents very infrequently thereafter. Powell does an excellent job of adapting the original story into pictorial format, hitting all of the high points and representing all of the major details in the drawings, so little is lost. For those unfamiliar with Riordan's storytelling, they will receive a healthy introduction to his easy-to-follow story lines that teach with great accuracy the mythologies that students will undoubtedly learn in the classroom but with such fun and ease that it will hardly feel like school. Readers who are new to reading comic books will be no less entertained; there are a few pages here and there that may make following the panels in order a touch challenging, but they will catch on quickly. It goes without saying that this book will fly off the shelves; Riordan, of course, has a ready-made audience, but he always does a good job of welcoming new readers, so this one is a must for both school and public libraries.&#x2014;Trina Bolfing, Westbank Libraries, Austin, TX</p><h2>The Wind in the Willows</h2><p><b>Dive into this heartwarming classic tale of friendship and adventure</b><br><br> <i>"Travel, change, interest, excitement!"</i><br><br> One day Mole pokes his nose out of his burrow and discovers that the world is an exciting place. He meets brave Ratty, kind old Badger, and the rascally Mr. Toad, and together they go adventuring . . . <i>The Wind in the Willows </i>is a classic animal adventure that charms and enthralls. This edition contains the original illustrations by E. H. Shepard, a partnership that has never been bettered.</p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud. Grahame's <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> has enchanted readers for four generations, and this lavishly illustrated gift edition is perhaps the finest around. <i>(All ages, or 9 to 12)</i> <p>This reviews refers to ISBN 0805002138.</p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 5: The Ties That Bind</h2><p>It's only been a year since the Elric brothers set out on their journey to find the elusive Philosopher's Stone.

Puryear (Nineteen Stars, not reviewed, etc.) attempts to find definitive answers. The author spent 35 years doing prodigious research, interviewing more than 100 four-star generals and over 1,000 leaders of every stripe, studying hundreds of biographies, memoirs, and military texts in his search for patterns and role models. He finds character the single most important element of exceptional leaders like Washington, Marshall, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Bradley, ``Billy'' Mitchell, Patton, ``Hap'' Arnold, Powell, and Schwarzkopf. Unselfishness, he adds, is essential in enabling leaders to disagree with superiors and put their careers on the line when they think their commanding officers are wrong. Making decisions has often been called the essence of leadership. Truman dropped the nuclear bomb to end the carnage of WWII and recognized the tiny state of Israel among a sea of enemies; MacArthur invaded Inchon to turn the Korean War around despite disagreements among his peers and advisers. Indecisiveness, contends Puryear, marks the poorest leaders. Some other patterns he discerns: Loyalty requires giving an honest opinion whether the boss likes it or not, but once a decision is made, the debate ends and the decision must be executed faithfully (Powell). Great leaders avoid yes men.'' Leaders mold more leaders. Intuition may be valuable if tempered by long experience and good judgment (Schwarzkopf). Most top commanders were voracious lifelong readers (MacArthur inherited 4,000 books from his military-hero father). Finally, Eisenhowerwho spent much time visiting his troops and junior officers, stimulating them to reveal hidden problemsshows the importance of listening to your followers. An excellent contribution to the study of leadership among those who make life-and-death decisions in the most challenging situationsone that could well serve as required reading in both military and business schools. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When the judge and his staff go to the scene of the crime during a burglary trial, we go with them on the sheriff&#x2019;s bus. We witness from behind the scenes the highest-profile case of the year: three young white men, one of them the son of a reputed mobster, charged with the racially motivated beating of a thirteen-year-old black boy. And we follow the cases that are the daily grind of the court, like that of the middle-aged man whose crack addiction brings him repeatedly back before the judge. <br>Bogira shows us how the war on drugs is choking the system, and how in most instances justice is dispensed&#x2013;as, under the circumstances, it must be&#x2013;rapidly and mindlessly. The stories that unfold in the courtroom are often tragic, but they no longer seem so to the people who work there. Says a deputy in 302: &#x201c;You hear this stuff every day, and you&#x2019;re like, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s go, let&#x2019;s go, let&#x2019;s get this over with and move on to the next thing.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br><br>Steve Bogira is, as Robert Caro says, &#x201c;a masterful reporter.&#x201d; His special gift is his understanding of people&#x2013;and his ability to make us see and understand them. Fast-paced, gripping, and bursting with character and incident, <i>Courtroom 302</i> is a unique illumination of our criminal court system that raises fundamental issues of race, civil rights, and justice.</p><p>Steve Bogira graduated from Northwestern University and has been a prize winning writer for the <i>Chicago Reader</i> since 1981. He is a former Alicia Patterson Fellow. He lives with his wife in Evanston, Illinois.Every day, Chicago police wagons swing onto the grounds of the Cook County Criminal Courthouse and deposit their cargo at a rear door.<br><br>The prisoners being unloaded on this particular evening&#x2014;January 20, 1998&#x2014;are here for the usual reasons. They sold cocaine rocks on a corner, until an unmarked car screeched up out of nowhere. They tried to buy heroin from an undercover cop. They pocketed a fifth of booze at a grocery and failed to outrun the security guard. They relieved a pickup truck of its tools and a nosy neighbor called 911.<br><br>At the district station, they pulled off their belts and pulled out their laces. They emptied their pockets of combs, cigarettes, matchbooks. They pressed their fingers onto the ink pad, frowned for the camera, and joined the rest of the day&#x2019;s catch in a frigid lockup. They curled up on a metal bench or a concrete floor and waited&#x2014;midnight, four in the morning, noon&#x2014;while computers checked their prints for outstanding warrants. They were treated to a baloney-on-white and coffee in a Styrofoam cup. Those with misdemeanor charges and no warrants were given a court date and released. The others were cuffed wrist to wrist and loaded into the large police wagon that swung by the station. The chain of prisoners in the wagon lengthened as the driver made pickups at other stations. The wagon bumped along toward the courthouse at 26th and California.<br><br>The Cook County Criminal Courthouse&#x2014;the biggest and busiest felony courthouse in the nation&#x2014;sits in a Mexican neighborhood on Chicago&#x2019;s southwest side. It&#x2019;s a boxy limestone structure, seven stories high and seven decades old, with Doric columns, Latin phrases carved into the limestone, and eight sculpted figures above the columns, representing law, justice, liberty, truth, might, love, wisdom, and peace. None of them is visible from the back of a police wagon.<br><br>A paunchy, balding white officer is behind the wheel of the first wagon to dip down a ramp and dock at the rear door this evening. He opens the wagon&#x2019;s tail, and a chain of fifteen men, a dozen black and three white, winds its way out. The prisoners are rumpled and rank&#x2013;the wagon-tossed, wretched refuse of a major American city, arrested on Martin Luther King Day. The driver follows the prisoners to the door, balancing over one shoulder a clear bag holding fifteen smaller clear bags that contain keys, combs, lip salve, cigarettes, lighters, beepers, eyeglasses, belts, shoelaces. In his other hand is a sheaf of arrest reports and rap sheets.<br><br>A navy-shirted sheriff &#x2019;s deputy slides open the barred door, and the prisoners file into the courthouse basement. About fifteen hundred prisoners pass through this doorway weekly on their way to a bond hearing&#x2014;78,000 men and women a year accused of violating the peace and dignity of the State of Illinois.<br><br>In thirty courtrooms on floors two through seven, plea deals are fashioned and hearings and trials conducted every weekday. But for most defendants, the first glimpse of the interior of the courthouse is of this cellar.<br><br>The cellar holds several dank chambers with cinder-block walls and metal benches bolted to concrete floors. The grimy walls have been decorated here and there by deputies who had a black marker or a tube of Preparation H and time on their hands. WELCOME TO COUNTY&#x2014;GET SERVED WITH A SMILE reads the script next to a horned and goateed grinning devil on a wall near the entrance. Other greetings: THIS WAY TO THE DANCE, and HEAD FIRST&#x2014;HIT HERE, and YOU WON'T BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.<br><br>Later tonight the prisoners will be escorted through a tunnel to the quivering elevator that will carry them up to Courtroom 100 for their bond hearings. At evening&#x2019;s end the lucky prisoners who can make bond or who get an &#x201c;I-bond&#x201d; (a no-money-down individual-recognizance bond) will walk out of the courthouse&#x2019;s front door. The rest of the prisoners&#x2014;about two-thirds of them, if this is a typical night&#x2014;will ride the elevator back downstairs and march through a longer tunnel to jail.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, fifteen desperate criminals,&#x201d; the paunchy officer tells the deputy at the entrance, one of twenty deputies working in the basement this evening. Yawning, the officer hands over the property bag and the paperwork.<br><br>The prisoners are directed to a bench in a bullpen down the hall, where they stand as they&#x2019;re told&#x2014;silently, backs of their legs against the edge of the bench. A second police officer is already at the door, dropping off three bleary-eyed black women. A deputy points them to a nearby bench. They step warily past Blackjack, a German shepherd, and Harley, a Rottweiler, the dogs straining toward them, tugging on the leashes gripped by two deputies.<br><br>Meanwhile a deputy in the bullpen at the end of the hall makes his way down the line of fifteen men, unlocking and collecting the handcuffs for the first wagon driver.<br><br>&#x201c;When the cuffs come off, your hands go behind your back,&#x201d; snaps the bull-necked, light-skinned African American deputy who&#x2019;s got the paperwork now. &#x201c;All right, when you hear your last name, tell me your first name. Powell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d;<br><br>Bullneck stalks over to Powell, a frail black youth in a neon-orange windbreaker. &#x201c;Is your first name <i>Here, </i>motherfucker?&#x201d; the deputy hollers in the startled youth&#x2019;s face.<br><br>The prisoners make it through the rest of roll call flawlessly, and then Bullneck directs them to sit. Another wagon arrives, and ten more disheveled males join the first fifteen in the back room. After they&#x2019;re uncuffed and checked in and have taken their seats on one of the benches that line three sides of the chamber, Bullneck welcomes them all to 26th Street.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t scare me,&#x201d; he tells them. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t intimidate me. And you sure fucking don&#x2019;t impress me.&#x201d; He informs the prisoners that they&#x2019;ll be going to bond court, and that after that they&#x2019;ll be headed home or to jail. But there&#x2019;s a third place they can end up if they don&#x2019;t follow the rules here, Bullneck warns&#x2014;the jail hospital.<br><br>The rules are simple and not to be questioned, he says&#x2014;no food, no phone calls, no smoking. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if you haven&#x2019;t eaten all week or made a phone call all day. It&#x2019;s not my problem.&#x201d; And the cardinal rule: in the hallways, on the elevator, in the courtroom upstairs, a prisoner&#x2019;s hands must remain behind his back. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know you. We don&#x2019;t know what the fuck is on your mind. You come out with your hands swinging, you&#x2019;re gonna get dropped,&#x201d; Bullneck says. &#x201c;If you forget every other rule I tell you, don&#x2019;t forget the hands-behind-the-back rule.&#x201d;<br><br>Bullneck surveys his mute, expressionless subjects.<br><br>&#x201c;Does everybody understand the fucking rules?&#x201d;<br><br>A handful of mumbled <i>yessir</i>s<i>.<br><br></i>&#x201c;Let me hear that <i>again.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes <i>sir</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>Next Bullneck announces &#x201c;freebie time,&#x201d; inviting the prisoners to surrender any drugs they&#x2019;ve managed to retain despite earlier searches by Chicago police. Nobody gets charged for what they give up now, he promises. But those who think they can sneak something by the deputies should know that Blackjack and Harley will be along presently. And if those dogs sniff a rock, a pinch of blow, or a roach, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re gonna get bit, and you&#x2019;re gonna get charged.&#x201d; As usual, no one takes advantage of freebie time.<br><br>Now Bullneck has the men remove their coats and jackets and toss them onto the floor in the middle of the room. Four deputies wearing black gloves work through the heap of sports team jackets and Salvation Army specials, exploring pockets and kneading collars and waistbands. Meanwhile Bullneck directs the prisoners to pull off their laceless sneakers or workboots, tear out any liners, and hold the shoes upside down by the toes, arms outstretched. The men dutifully comply, and in a moment a ring of stocking-footed men are wordlessly offering up their soles to him.<br><br>&#x201c;And when I tell you to, don&#x2019;t bang &#x2019;em like a buncha pussies,&#x201d; Bullneck says. &#x201c;Bang &#x2019;em so anything inside falls out.&#x201d; He studies the group; all eyes are on him.<br><br>&#x201c;Now&#x2014;<i>bang </i>&#x2019;em!&#x201d;<br><br>A host of arms are immediately pumping, <i>beating </i>those shoes and boots together, admirably unpussylike, the stampede echoing off the walls for a quarter of a minute, until Bullneck raises a hand.

A yeasty odor rises in the room.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, everybody stand up!&#x201d; Bullneck bellows. &#x201c;Turn around, grab some wall!&#x201d; The four gloved deputies commence the pat-downs. It&#x2019;s not a penetrating search: anyone willing to tuck a cocaine rock up his butt will get away with it for now, but those who end up going to jail had better smoke up that rock in the jail bullpens before the strip-search there. Blackjack and Harley are mainly showpieces, Bullneck&#x2019;s warning about the dogs&#x2019; impending sniff-search an empty threat. The deputies are checking for weapons now more than drugs. They don&#x2019;t trust the pat-downs of Chicago&#x2019;s finest; prisoners have arrived here with knives in their pockets, the deputies claim. (Chicago cops &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t find their ass with both hands,&#x201d; one deputy says.)<br><br>A skinny Hispanic man awaiting his search foolishly peeks over his shoulder. The boss here tonight, the white-shirted Sergeant London Thomas, who&#x2019;s been watching the pat-downs from just outside the bullpen, is at the skinny man&#x2019;s side in an instant. &#x201c;What the <i>fuck</i>&#x2019;re you staring at <i>me </i>for?...</p><h2>Three Masquerades: Novellas by Rachel Ingalls</h2><p>"<p><i>The fiction of Rachel Ingalls has haunted me for years.

Drawing on a wealth of sources, Heidenry offers a well-rounded account of how Roy DeWitt Wallace (``Wally'' to intimates) built a farflung communications empire on an idea revived while he recovered from wounds suffered in WW I. Back in the States, the thirtysomething Wally came up with enough money to publish the first edition of Reader's Digest in February 1922. The monthly's format and content, almost immediate hits with middle America, have changed little since then. From its original venue in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, however, RD moved to Pleasantville, an N.Y.C. exurb. In later life, Wally, who had deliberately overstated the editorial role played by his wife, Lila Acheson, to enhance the fledgling journal's drawing power with women, downplayed her apparently negligible contributions. Whoever was responsible, the magazine proved to have mass appeal outside the US, and more than a dozen foreign editions were successfully launched. Though a frequent object of the literary establishment's scorn, RD prospered in good times and bad as the proprietors (who lured name writers with top pay) developed a flair for direct-mail promotion and a willingness to break with tradition, e.g., by opening their pages to advertisers in the mid-50's. RD has survived the death of its founders (both of whom lived into their 90s) in good style, remaining the keystone of a profitable media enterprise with new worlds to conquer in Eastern Europe and beyond. If Heidenry doesn't always endorse the odd amalgam of political conservatism, religious uplift, and double-entendre humor that has made Reader's Digest a perdurable institution, he offers an evenhanded appreciation of its socioeconomic attractions, as well as generally admiring but unsparing portraits of the principals and their key subordinates. As complete a wrap-up, then, as general readers could want on a commercial/cultural phenomenon. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By the author of Stand Up for Your Life. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>In <i>The Unmistakable Touch of Grace</i>, bestselling author Cheryl Richardson (<i>Take Time for Your Life</i> and <i>Life Makeovers</i>) moves away from advice about tangible topics, and shares with readers her twenty-year journey of discovery about how the benevolent energy of the Universe, which she calls "the unmistakable grace" works to shape our lives and guide us towards our ultimate spiritual destiny. According to Richardson, there is a Higher Power that has our best interest at heart and uses grace to guide us to better understand the Divine Plan. The goal of this book is to help readers become more aware of how grace touches their lives, and to teach them to be able to better recognize the touch of grace and to surrender to it so that "the right doors will open to support you in fulfilling tour life&#x2019;s purpose." <p> There are no coincidences, Richardson writes. Everything and everyone we experience comes into our lives for a reason and are &#x2018;blessings in disguise." Understanding those reasons and viewing life from a spiritual perspective is at the heart of her message. In addition to revealing personal examples from her own life, Richardson shares many other stories to reveal how grace can make dramatic, positive differences in our lives once it is perceived and surrendered to. To aid the reader in those steps, Richardson provides a wealth of exercises at the end of each chapter. She calls such exercises experiments, and encourages readers to perform them with others so that everyone involved can witness their dramatic effects on each other. She also provides additional resources that readers can use to further their self-discovery. </p><p> With <i>The Unmistakable Touch of Grace</i>, writing in a style that is both warm and informative, Richardson joins the ranks of other inspirational authors such as Wayne Dyer and Eckhart Tolle, with a work that is both provocative and empowering, and a very useful resource for anyone who desires to increase their awareness of the seeds of miracles contained in everyday experiences.</p>Twenty years ago, I made a decision to wake up and alter the direction of my life. This set in motion a series of events that proved to me there are no coincidences. Every event we experience and every person we meet has been put in our path for a reason. When we awaken to this fundamental truth, we begin to understand that a benevolent force of energy is available to guide and direct our lives. I call this energy the unmistakable touch of grace. <p>This book tells the story of how grace has transformed my life as well as the lives of others. While some stories may seem unbelievable, all of them are true. As you follow the journey, you'll start to see the influence of grace in your life, too. And, once you've finished, the way you view your life (and the people in it) will be changed forever. Many blessings, Cheryl</p></p><h2>Picturing Us: African American Identity in Photography</h2><p>A study of African American identity is the creation of an expert on African-American photography who asked writers, critics, and filmmakers to select a photograph of personal or historical significance and &#34;read&#34; it for insights into the black experience.</p><p>Deborah Willis is curator of exhibitions at the National African American Museum Project of the Smithsonian Institute. Her previous books include <i>Early Black Photographers: 1840 to 1940</i> and <i>VanDerZee: Photographer 1886&#x2013;1983</i>. She lives in Washington, D.C.<br>In 18 stimulating essays, black writers, scholars and critics reflect on individual photographs-often a family snapshot-to address questions of black identity (but not a black photographic aesthetic). If a portrait of his mother conjures up lost dreams for Edward P. Jones, a picture of her T-shirted father reminds bell hooks how her sisters differ in their view of him; and a photo of a many-hued family suggests to Christian Walker the politics of skin color. Some photos dredge up history: in an 1850s daguerreotype of a nude woman, Carla Williams finds a stimulus for questions of black sexuality; Claudine Brown finds implications for the present in a dignified 1901 mug shot. Others represent the essayists' view of politics: to Clarissa Sligh, newspaper photos from 1956 recall white demonization of integration; to Angela Davis, current popularity of her iconic afro suggests a triumph of fashion over politics. Willis, collections coordinator of the National African-American Museum Project of the Smithsonian Institution, has begun a worthy dialogue on an under-analyzed aspect of black history.

In the years since, Morse&#39;s book, especially in its second edition, has become the working replacement of Rayleigh&#39;s for acoustics teachers and researchers who seek a firm mathematical foundation for their work. After a brief survey of useful mathematics (up to the level of contour integration and Fourier transforms) and a thorough account of the mathematics of free and damped oscillations, the author takes the flexible string through all its motions and then stiffens it for the cases of wires and bars. Attention is then turned to the two-dimensional equivalents of these cases-membranes and plates. Thus, fully half the book is devoted to vibrations. In the second half of the book, Professor Morse treats the cases of planewave propagation in an undamped medium, propagation in tubes and horns, and then, in a masterful chapter, the radiation, and scattering of sound, finishing with a chapter on standing waves and room acoustics. Throughout the book, the mathematics is developed clearly and with rigor, and worked examples and detailed results are given. At the same time as teaching acoustics, the books can also serve as a vehicle for the study of Bessel functions, normal modes, perturbation theory, and other mathematical techniques. There is plenty of problems given in each chapter.</p><p></p><h2>The Falls: A Novel</h2><p><p>A stunning, major achievement from Joyce Carol Oates, "one of the great artistic forces of our time" (<em>The Nation</em>). A haunting story of the powerful spell Niagara Falls casts upon two generations of a family, leading to tragedy, love, loss, and, ultimately, redemption.</p><p>A man climbs over the railings and plunges into Niagara Falls. A newlywed, he has left behind his wife, Ariah Erskine, in the honeymoon suite the morning after their wedding. "The Widow Bride of The Falls," as Ariah comes to be known, begins a relentless, seven-day vigil in the mist, waiting for his body to be found. At her side throughout, confirmed bachelor and pillar of the community Dirk Burnaby is unexpectedly transfixed by the strange, otherworldly gaze of this plain, strange woman, falling in love with her though they barely exchange a word. What follows is their passionate love affair, marriage, and children -- a seemingly perfect existence.</p><p>But the tragedy by which their life together began shadows them, damaging their idyll with distrust, greed, and even murder. What unfurls is a drama of parents and their children; of secrets and sins; of lawsuits, murder, and, eventually, redemption. As Ariah's children learn that their past is enmeshed with a hushed-up scandal involving radioactive waste, they must confront not only their personal history but America's murky past: the despoiling of the landscape, and the corruption and greed of the massive industrial expansion of the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>Set against the mythic-historic backdrop of Niagara Falls, Joyce Carol Oates explores the American family in crisis, but also America itself in the mid-twentieth century. As in <em>We Were the Mulvaneys</em>, a "darkly engrossing novel" (<em>Washington Post</em> Book World), she examines what happens when the richly interwoven relationships of parents and their children are challenged by circumstances outside the family.</p><p><em>The Falls</em> is a love story gone wrong and righted, and it alone places Joyce Carol Oates definitively in the company of the great American novelists.</p></p><p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is a recipient of the National Medal of Humanities, the National Book Critics Circle Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award, the National Book Award, and the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in Short Fiction, and has been several times nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. She has written some of the most enduring fiction of our time, including the national bestsellers <em>We Were the Mulvaneys</em>,<em> Blonde</em>, which was nominated for the National Book Award, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Falls</em>, which won the 2005 Prix Femina. Her most recent novel is <em>A Book of American Martyrs</em>. She is the Roger S. Berlind Distinguished Professor of the Humanities at Princeton University and has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters since 1978.</p><p></p>Anna Fields's skilled voice creates Niagara Falls as a living and unforgiving character, echoing and resonating in this family story. Opening with a startling courtship and marriage, Fields brings the characters and environment to life, building to a crescendo as powerful as the Falls themselves. (It's awesome to realize that a human voice can make so real the men, women, and children of this saga.) Be prepared for emotional moments as the story peaks, ebbs, and peaks again, and love is found in the most surprising places. In the end, you'll feel you know these people and share their sorrows and occasional joys.

Instead of a sociohistorical process of disenchantment that produces increasingly rational minds, Asprem maintains that the continued presence of &#x201c;magic&#x201d; and &#x201c;enchantment&#x201d; in people&#x2019;s everyday experience of the world created an intellectual <i>problem</i> for those few who were socialized to believe that nature should contain no such incalculable mysteries. Drawing on a wide range of early twentieth-century primary sources from theoretical physics, occultism, embryology, radioactivity, psychical research, and other fields, Asprem casts the intellectual life of high modernity as a synchronic struggle across conspicuously different fields that shared surprisingly similar intellectual problems about value, meaning, and the limits of knowledge.</p><p><p>Egil Asprem is Associate Professor of History of Religions at the Department of Ethnology, History of Religions, and Gender Studies, Stockholm University, and the author of <i>Arguing with Angels: Enochian Magic and Modern Occulture</i>, also published by SUNY Press.</p>&#x201c;This challenging book is a fascinating complexification of the modern era&#x2019;s scientific history.&#x201d; &#x2015; <i>CHOICE</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Problem of Disenchantment</i> is, in its entirety, extraordinarily well researched, argued, and written&#x2015;representing at once the most complete and nuanced treatment of the notion of disenchantment within this network of scientific, religious, philosophical, and esoteric discourses and currents.&#x201d; &#x2015; <i>Nova Religio</i></p><h2>The Forester&#39;s Log: Musings from the Woods</h2><p><p>When Mary Stuever graduated from forestry school in the early 1980s, her profession was facing tremendous challenges as the nation's forests were poised for serious decline from catastrophic wildfires, insect outbreaks, and suburban encroachment. Stuever captured this transition over the last few decades in her syndicated monthly column "The Forester's Log." Originally penned for newspapers in rural forested communities in the Southwest, the column has found its way into various magazines, newsletters, anthologies, and Web sites.</p><p>Stuever's career involves firefighting, fire rehabilitation, timber sale administration, environmental education, and many other aspects of forest management. Through her work with native tribes, local, state, and federal agencies, and private landowners, Stuever focuses on the important bond between land and people. With an inspiring and informative style, Stuever's tales weave fresh insight into forest issues.

Johnson has written dozens of national award-winning books that highlight why science is such an exciting endeavor: there are no shortages of new species, remarkable adaptations, and fresh insights into life on earth. She believes that scientists have the world's best jobs, and has been fortunate to work with many of them in far-flung corners of the planet, including Antarctica's frozen interior and the ocean's abyss. <br> <br> "Through my writing, I hope to show young people that the world is full of wonders, and that science is the path that leads to them."<br> </p>Gr. 2-4. This entry in the new Biomes of North America series has several particularly nice features: the glossary precedes the text, a map defines the location, and the good resources section includes both books and Web sites. The writing style is lively, though Johnson goes a bit overboard in trying to give children a close-up view of the tundra: "Feel how squishy the ground is beneath your feet." She packs in plenty about the habitat, though, from climate to enlightening bits about flora and fauna, and she also conveys a strong sense of the way the hustle and bustle of summer is just a preliminary to nine months of bitter winter. There's a nicely varied selection of color photographs; sidebar "Post-its," each with a black-and-white drawing, help make the design more interesting but add little information. That's a small gripe, however, in a book that does a lot. See Series Roundup for more titles. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Nobel laureate Gerald M. Edelman takes issue with the many current cognitive and behavioral approaches to the brain that leave biology out of the picture, and argues that the workings of the brain more closely resemble the living ecology of a jungle than they do the activities of a computer. Some startling conclusions emerge from these ideas: individuality is necessarily at the very center of what it means to have a mind, no creature is born value-free, and no physical theory of the universe can claim to be a &#x201d;theory of everything&#x201d; without including an account of how the brain gives rise to the mind. There is no greater scientific challenge than understanding the brain. <i>Bright Air, Brilliant Fire</i> is a book that provides a window on that understanding.</p><p><b>Gerald M. Edelman</b> is director of the Neurosciences Institute and chairman of the Department of Neurobiology at the Scripps Research Institute. He received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1972. He is also the author of <i>Bright Air, Brilliant Fire; Tobiology</i>; and <i>The Remembered Present</i>.``Strenuous'' is how Nobelist (Physiology or Medicine, 1972) Edelman describes the difficulties readers will encounter as they ply their way through yet another texty analysis of what it means to be a mind. Like Stephen M. Kosslyn and Olivier Koenig (Wet Mind, p. 235) and Israel Rosenfield (reviewed below), he likes to use old words in new ways, to coin complex hyphenated forms, and in other ways to multiply the prolixity level. Indeed, the three volumes complement one another. All speak to the need to ground analyses of mental functions in brain biology; all abhor cognitive-science approaches that look to the computer as the model of how the brain works. Edelman's approach is based on his theory of neuronal group selection (``TNGS''), which says that groups of neurons compete in the course of brain development, with surviving groups subject to a second selection in which specific pathways and synapses are strengthened according to whether they yield good or useful outcomes to the organism. Finally, there are broad, reciprocal interactions across neuronal groups that yield numerous brain ``maps.'' These ideas mark an evolution of Edelman's earlier work in immunity and development, in which Darwinian selection also figured. Indeed, evolution is key to Edelman's thinking. He, like Rosenfield, sees the emergence of a primary consciousness (possessed by birds and mammals?) rooted in the present and a high- order consciousness (and self-consciousness) occurring in humans as the result of the development of language. Edelman's many allusions to pivotal thinkers in philosophy and science enrich the historical context of his discussions. In the end, however, even he admits the daunting nature of the challenge. How to deal with logic, art, creativity, motivation, emotions? How to relate the importance of social interaction in development and throughout life? We can not yet, and perhaps never will, eliminate philosophy or psychology from the discussion. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It's not just about a few techniques to ward off a local thug. It's about tilting the playing field completely in your favor, making sure if you're ever in a hostile situation, you walk away with your life. <br><br> To do that requires an understanding of principles; an education in the facts of violence. Others give you techniques for specific situations. Finish this book and you'll understand why that's a recipe for disaster. <br><br> Most people stumble into martial arts or combat sports never really considering why. Each trains you for competition in a safe environment, with rules and supervision agreed in advance. Both give you effective tactics for fighting, and are great for conditioning. <br><br> But if sport fighting is your thing, this book will say nothing to you. Its total focus is real violence, the kind everyone wants to avoid. It's about dealing with life-or-death threats where no rules exist. And that's completely different than sport fighting. <br><br> And there lies the difference. This book addresses that place where social communication ends and real violence begins, the point where you have no control, and there's no one to help. It's the situations we all pretend doesn't exist... even though we all know they do. <br><br> The real question is face-to-face with life-or-death violence, can you defend yourself and your family? Because in that moment, nothing else matters. <br><br> To learn the answer, read this book. You may not like what the authors have to say but by the end you'll see the truth: that there's only one guaranteed way for anyone to walk away from a hostile situation alive. It's not pretty but once you understand it... it'll change your life forever.</p><p></p><h2>Midnight&#39;s Children</h2><p>This is a history of India since independence, seen through the eyes of characters born on the day that independence was granted. The book is a multi-layered narrative, in which the complexities of the sub-continent are projected through the minds of its many characters. &#34;Midnight&#39;s Children&#34; was voted in the Booker of Bookers in 1993.</p><p>Anyone who has spent time in the developing world will know that one of Bombay's claims to fame is the enormous film industry that churns out hundreds of musical fantasies each year. The other, of course, is native son Salman Rushdie--less prolific, perhaps than Bollywood, but in his own way just as fantastical. Though Rushdie's novels lack the requisite six musical numbers that punctuate every Bombay talkie, they often share basic plot points with their cinematic counterparts. Take, for example, his 1980 Booker Prize-winning <i>Midnight's Children</i>: two children born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947--the moment at which India became an independent nation--are switched in the hospital. The infant scion of a wealthy Muslim family is sent to be raised in a Hindu tenement, while the legitimate heir to such squalor ends up establishing squatters' rights to his unlucky hospital mate's luxurious bassinet. Switched babies are standard fare for a Hindi film, and one can't help but feel that Rushdie's world-view--and certainly his sense of the fantastical--has been shaped by the films of his childhood. But whereas the movies, while entertaining, are markedly mediocre, <i>Midnight's Children</i> is a masterpiece, brilliant written, wildly unpredictable, hilarious and heartbreaking in equal measure.<p> Rushdie's narrator, Saleem Sinai, is the Hindu child raised by wealthy Muslims. Near the beginning of the novel, he informs us that he is falling apart--literally: </p><blockquote>I mean quite simply that I have begun to crack all over like an old jug--that my poor body, singular, unlovely, buffeted by too much history, subjected to drainage above and drainage below, mutilated by doors, brained by spittoons, has started coming apart at the seams. In short, I am literally disintegrating, slowly for the moment, although there are signs of an acceleration.</blockquote> In light of this unfortunate physical degeneration, Saleem has decided to write his life story, and, incidentally, that of India's, before he crumbles into "(approximately) six hundred and thirty million particles of anonymous, and necessarily oblivious, dust." It seems that within one hour of midnight on India's independence day, 1,001 children were born. All of those children were endowed with special powers: some can travel through time, for example; one can change gender. Saleem's gift is telepathy, and it is via this power that he discovers the truth of his birth: that he is, in fact, the product of the illicit coupling of an Indian mother and an English father, and has usurped another's place. His gift also reveals the identities of all the other children and the fact that it is in his power to gather them for a "midnight parliament" to save the nation. To do so, however, would lay him open to that other child, christened Shiva, who has grown up to be a brutish killer. Saleem's dilemma plays out against the backdrop of the first years of independence: the partition of India and Pakistan, the ascendancy of "The Widow" Indira Gandhi, war, and, eventually, the imposition of martial law.<p> We've seen this mix of magical thinking and political reality before in the works of G�nter Grass and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. What sets Rushdie apart is his mad prose pyrotechnics, the exuberant acrobatics of rhyme and alliteration, pun, wordplay, proper and "Babu" English chasing each other across the page in a dizzying, exhilarating cataract of words. Rushdie can be laugh-out-loud funny, but make no mistake--this is an angry book, and its author's outrage lends his language wings. <i>Midnight's Children</i> is Salman Rushdie's irate, affectionate love song to his native land--not so different from a Bombay talkie, after all. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Born at the stroke of midnight at the exact moment of India&#x2019;s independence, Saleem Sinai is a special child. However, this coincidence of birth has consequences he is not prepared for: telepathic powers connect him with 1,000 other &#x2018;midnight&#x2019;s children&#x2019; all of whom are endowed with unusual gifts. Inextricably linked to his nation, Saleem&#x2019;s story is a whirlwind of disasters and triumphs that mirrors the course of modern India at its most impossible and glorious</p><h2>The Streets are Free</h2><p>This inspiring book is based on the true story of the children of the barrio of San Jose de la Urbina in Caracas, Venezuela. There are no parks where they live, and the children must play in the streets. They ask the mayor for an empty lot to build a playground, but all they get are campaign promises. They know that they are the only ones who will make something happen, so they get their friends and family involved until the whole barrio unites to create a space of their own.</p><p><p> Founded in 1975, <b>Annick Press</b> is a leading Canadian publisher of books for children of all ages.

At first they were few, but in the '50s thousands came from the towns and villages to live in big cities like Caracas and Maracaibo. </p> <p>The cities were not ready to receive these new inhabitants. There were no houses for them, no waterworks, no sewers, no electricity. And, even worse, there was not enough work for all. Many of them stayed on the outskirts of the cities in cramped shacks, uncomfortable and miserable. Sometimes they had to fight to keep their empty lots.</p> <p>In Caracas, the people coming from the rural areas occupied the hills surrounding the city, hoping that someday they would live in the valley below, without the fear of landslides, with enough drinking water, without the smell of sewers and garbage. But most of them stayed there. And each year more people came. Today, almost half of the population of Caracas lives in these "barrios."</p> <p><i>The Streets are Free</i> is based on the true story of the children of the barrio of San Jos� de la Urbina, who wanted a place to play. They still don't have it, but continue dreaming and fighting for their playground. </p></p><h2>The Ecstasy of Influence: Nonfictions, Etc.</h2><p>What&#x2019;s a novelist supposed to do with contemporary culture? And what&#x2019;s contemporary culture sup�posed to do with novelists? In <i>The Ecstasy of Influence</i>, Jonathan Lethem, tangling with what he calls the &#x201c;white elephant&#x201d; role of the writer as public intellectual, arrives at an astonishing range of answers. <br> <br> A constellation of previously published pieces and new essays as provocative and idiosyncratic as any he&#x2019;s written, this volume sheds light on an array of topics from sex in cinema to drugs, graffiti, Bob Dylan, cyberculture, 9/11, book touring, and Marlon Brando, as well as on a shelf&#x2019;s worth of his literary models and contemporaries: Norman Mailer, Paula Fox, Bret Easton Ellis, James Wood, and oth�ers. And, writing about Brooklyn, his father, and his sojourn through two decades of writing, Lethem sheds an equally strong light on himself.</p><p><b>JONATHAN LETHEM </b>is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eight novels, including <i>Chronic City</i>, <i>The Fortress of Solitude</i>, and <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i>.<p>&nbsp;<br>Postmodernism as Liberty Valance <br><i><br>Notes on a Ritual Killing <br></i><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Spoiler alert. John Ford&#x2019;s <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> is an allegorical Western that I am now going to totally pretzel into an alle�gory for something else entirely. Actually I&#x2019;ll reverse it: The original allegorizes the taming of the western frontier, the coming of moder�nity in the form of the lawbooks and the locomotive, and memorializes what was lost (a loss the film sees as inevitable). My version allegorizes the holding at bay, for the special province of literary fiction, of con�temporary experience in all its dismaying or exhilarating particulars, as well as a weird persistent denial of a terrific number of artistic strat�egies for illuminating that experience. The avoidance, that&#x2019;s to say, of any forthright address of what&#x2019;s called postmodernity, and what&#x2019;s lost in avoiding it (a sacrifice I see as at best pointless, an empty rehearsal of anxieties, and at worst hugely detrimental for fiction). <br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The chewy center of <i>TMWSLV</i> is a gunfight. A man stands in the main street of a western town and (apparently) kills another man. The victim&#x2014;for this is, technically, murder&#x2014;represents chaos and anxi�ety and fear to all who know him, and has been regarded as unkill�able, almost in the manner of a monster or zombie from another movie genre; his dispatch is regarded by the local population with astonished relief and gratitude, such that they will shower the killer with regard (he&#x2019;s destined to become his party&#x2019;s nominee for vice president of the United States). The secret the movie reveals: The killer was not the man in the street, but another. <br>&nbsp;<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three persons in <i>TMWSLV</i>: James Stewart a.k.a. &#x201c;Ransom Stoddard,&#x201d; the upstanding, even priggish young lawyer from the east, defined by his na�ve sincerity and dedication to the rule of law; John Wayne a.k.a. &#x201c;Tom Doniphon,&#x201d; cynical veteran of the frontier, who tends to an isolationist-libertarian approach toward civilization but is essentially lovable and will become heartbreaking by film&#x2019;s end; and Lee Marvin a.k.a. &#x201c;Liberty Valance,&#x201d; a sadistic, amoral thug who delights in sowing chaos and exposing the fragility of social convention (by terrorizing family restaurants, newspaper offices, elections, etc.). <br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stewart/Stoddard believes he&#x2019;s &#x201c;the man who killed Liberty Valance&#x201d; (he stood, after all, in the center of town, visible to all, with a gun in his hand). More important, the witnesses believe he&#x2019;s the one. In fact, it was Wayne/Doniphon who did the deed, while hidden in a shadowy alley, after having elaborately conspired to goad the helpless and paci�fistic Stewart/Stoddard into his public role as a gun-toting defender of public peace against the savage anarchy of Marvin/Valance. <br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Liberty Valance, i.e., &#x201c;Free Persuasion&#x201d;&#x2014;what an absurd, obvious, Pynchonian name! But then, the characters in Dickens and Henry James have odd names, too. <br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Venturing back in time isn&#x2019;t the only option for novelists loath to address the mass media that most Americans marinate in. There are also those populations cut off from the mainstream for cultural rea�sons, such as recent immigrants and their families. And then there are those at the geographical margins . . . It&#x2019;s remarkable how many recent American literary novels and short stories are set on ranches . . . The American novelist is buffeted by two increasingly contradictory imper�atives. The first comes as the directive to depict &#x2018;The Way We Live Now&#x2019; . . . Clich� it may be, but the notion that no one is better suited to explain the dilemmas of contemporary life than the novelist per�sists . . . [The] other designated special province of the literary novelist: museum-quality depth. The further literature is driven to the outskirts of the culture, the more it is cherished as a sanctuary from everything coarse, shallow and meretricious in that culture. If these two missions seem incompatible, that&#x2019;s because they are. To encompass both . . . you must persuade your readers that you have given them what they want by presenting them with what they were trying to get away from when they came to you in the first place.&#x201d; <br><i>&#x2014;</i>Laura Miller, <i>The Guardian </i><br><br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#x2019;s wade into the unpleasantness around the term &#x201c;postmodern�ism&#x201d;: Nobody agrees on its definition, but in literary conversations the word is often used as finger-pointing to a really vast number of things that might be seen as threatening to canonical culture: author-killing theories generated by French critics, collapsings of high and low cultural preserves into a value-neutral fog, excessive reference to various other media and/or mediums, especially electronic ones (ironically, even a Luddishly denunciatory take on certain media and/or mediums may be suspect merely for displaying an excess of familiarity with same), an enthusiasm for &#x201c;metafiction&#x201d; (a word that ought to be reserved for a specific thing that starts with Cervantes, but isn&#x2019;t), for antinarrative, for pop-culture references or generic forms, for overt (as opposed to politely passive) &#x201c;intertextuality,&#x201d; for unreliable narration, for surre�alism or magic realism or hysterical realism or some other brand of &#x201c;opposed- to- realism&#x201d; affiliation, for &#x201c;irony&#x201d; (another term that&#x2019;s been abused out of its effective contour and function, and its abusers have fewer excuses than do those of postmodernism), etc. etc. etc. Now, any writer espousing, let alone employing, all of the above things would be a gorgon-headed monster, surely deserving rapid assassination for the safety of the literary community in general. (Or maybe not, maybe they&#x2019;d be splendid.) But&#x2014;and I present this as axiomatic&#x2014;such a person, and such writing, is impossible to consider seriously because all of the modes denounced under the banner of &#x201c;postmodernist&#x201d; are incompatible: You can&#x2019;t, just for instance, exalt disreputable genres like the crime story and also want to do away with narrative. <br>&nbsp;<br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reverse person, a literary person inclined toward or at least com�pelled by none of the above-named modes or gestures&#x2014;and I present this not as axiomatic but as an obnoxious opinion&#x2014;would be dull beyond belief. They basically would have declined the entire twentieth century (and interesting parts of several others). <i>You&#x2019;ve read our entire menu, sir? And nothing was of interest? Really,</i> nothing<i>? </i><br><br>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c; . . . as a phenomenon, postmodernism is either specifically aes�thetic or more generally cultural; it is either revolutionary or reaction�ary; it is either the end of ideology or the inescapable conclusion of ideology . . . It is expressed in architecture, art, literature, the media, science, religion and fashion, and at the same time it is equivalent to none of these. It is both a continuation and intensification of what has gone before and a radical break with all traces of the past. It is, above all, simultaneously critical and complicit.&#x201d; <br><i>&#x2014;</i>Kathleen Fitzpatrick, <i>The Anxiety of Obsolescence </i><br>&#x201c;Critical debates about postmodernism constitute postmodernism itself.&#x201d; <br><i>&#x2014;</i>Stephen Connor,<i> Postmodernist Culture </i><br>&nbsp;<br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggested that abusers of the word &#x201c;postmodernism&#x201d; had excuses. I offer the above quotes as exculpatory evidence. The serious use of the term manifestly propagates bewilderment. But the quotes are also a reminder that the term has serious uses. It means more than &#x201c;art I don&#x2019;t like.&#x201d; <br><br>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; What postmodernism really needs is a new name&#x2014;or three of them. <br><br>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first &#x201c;postmodernism&#x201d; that requires a new name is our sense&#x2014; I&#x2019;m taking it for granted that you share it&#x2014;that the world, as presently defined by the advent of global techno-capitalism, the McLuhanesque effects of electronic media, and the long historical postludes of the transformative theories, movements, and traumas of the twentieth century, isn&#x2019;t a coherent or congenial home for human psyches. Chuck Klosterman details this suspicion in his essay on the Unabomber, called &#x201c;FAIL&#x201d; (though it might as well be called &#x201c;Sympathy for Theo�dore Kaczynski&#x201d;). His conclusion, basically, is that in the teeth of con�temporary reality we&#x2019;d all be a little bit crazy <i>not</i> to sometimes wish to kill that sort of postmodernism. I speak here as one who&#x2019;s spent loads of his own good faith hurling tiny word-bombs at the rolling edifice of the triumphalist Now. This postmodernism we&#x2019;ll call Kaczynski&#x2019;s Bad Dream. <br>&nbsp;<br>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second substitute term I&#x2019;ll offer is for the avowed, self-declared postmodernist school of U.S. fiction writers: Robert Coover, John Barth, Donald Barthelme, Stanley Elkin, William Gass, John Hawkes, a few others, many of them one another&#x2019;s friends, and many of them influential teachers. A few non-teachers&#x2014;Pynchon, of course (unless he was teaching high-school social studies or geometry somewhere). This clan, when Barth and Pynchon were scooping up major prizes, rode high enough that they seemed worth knocking down. This is the epoch John Gardner tilted against in <i>On Moral Fiction</i>. True, this tribe once had the effrontery to imagine itself the center of interest in U.S. fiction, but if you still hold that grudge your memory for effrontery is too long.

This first survey of his work in over 20 years includes his portraits for the first time as well as some new discoveries never before reproduced. Bibliography; notes; index. 200 duotone photos.</p><p>VanDerZee was the first 20th-century African American photographer to achieve commercial success and fame. Between the wars, he ran a photography studio in Harlem, where he documented the famous and the everyday of the Harlem Renaissance more thoroughly than any other photographer. Thanks to the inclusion of some of his images in the 1969 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition "Harlem on My Mind," he was rediscovered at age 83, living in poverty in Harlem. Before he died, he again took up the camera to photograph many prominent African Americans, including Muhammad Ali, Romare Bearden, and Bill Cosby. Published on the occasion of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, this first major survey of his work in 20 years presents a full retrospective in high-quality reproductions. Willis-Braithwaite ( Black Photographers, 1840-1988 , 1985) and Birt (humanities, San Francisco State Univ.) provide excellent essays tracing VanDerZee's life and work, while detailed captions accompany the photos.

Reprint.</p><p>Gregg Hurwitz's father, sister, and grandfather were all physicians, so growing up, he was regaled at dinnertime with tales of bleeding colons and severed fingers. He was also subjected to vigorous discussion regarding the boundaries of medical ethics, which provided him a foundation for writing <i>Do No Harm.</i> In the course of researching the novel, he shadowed doctors in the UCLA emergency room, harassed government operatives to teach him surveillance techniques, and delved into psychological research on childhood trauma. <p><i>Minutes to Burn</i> originated during Hurwitz's research travel in the Gal�pagos, where he confronted marine iguanas on lava plains, hiked through the islands' curious Scalesia forests, and contended with enormous crab spiders in shower stalls and toilet bowls. Upon his return, he spent months tracking down scientific experts around the world -- ecologists, geologists, entomologists, virologists -- continuing to indulge his fascination in the archipelago and to flesh out what would become <i>Minutes to Burn.</i> While undertaking the military research for the novel, Hurwitz dealt with an extensive network of Navy SEALs and related operators. He was obligated to familiarize himself with sidearms, meals-ready-to-eat, M-16s, SWAT ranges, and hand-to-hand techniques -- much to the derisive amusement of attendant Navy SEALs.</p><p>Hurwitz grew up in the Bay Area. While completing a BA from Harvard and a master's from Oxford, he wrote his first novel, <i>The Tower,</i> a psychological thriller set in and around San Francisco.</p><p>Hurwitz has published several academic articles. He lives in Los Angeles, where he is working on his fourth thriller and the screenplay of <i>Rogue Warrior</i> (based on Richard Marcinko's autobiography) for Jerry Bruckheimer Films.</p>It is the year 2007, earthquakes rattle the globe, the ozone layer is shot and evolution kicks into overdrive in this gripping action-movie-in-waiting. Hurwitz has engineered a deft recombinant blend of a thriller, tossing in lots of scientific speculation ... la Crichton in Jurassic Park mode, a ragtag Navy SEAL crew reminiscent of the Aliens heroes, some Predator and a dash of Rambo. In his jam-packed tale, a rogue virus appears on one of the Gal&nbsp;pagos islands, and soon the remote archipelago is populated by nine-foot-tall man-eating monsters. Unaware of the infestation, scientists are sent from the U.S. to set up seismic sensors, and a team of seven Navy SEALs are assigned to escort them. Team members include husband-and-wife Justin and Cameron, who is not quite showing her pregnancy; squad leader Derek, having problems with concentration, much less command; and the gigantic Tank, among others. Most enjoyable is the 50ish knife-wielding Nam vet, Savage, who practically steals the book. Stranded on the island without guns after a series of screwups, the team is sucked into a nightmarish chase, turned from hunters to hunted and back again. Hurwitz's first novel, The Tower, was labeled a satire of serial killer novels by some reviewers. This page-turner keeps a satiric edge, too, while Hurwitz proves he is perfectly at home with toothy creatures on the rampage and a thrilling array of other soon-to-be FX.

"Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." On the most basic level, a habit is a simple neurological loop: there is a cue (my mouth feels gross), a routine (hello, Crest), and a reward (ahhh, minty fresh). Understanding this loop is the key to exercising regularly or becoming more productive at work or tapping into reserves of creativity. Marketers, too, are learning how to exploit these loops to boost sales; CEOs and coaches are using them to change how employees work and athletes compete. As this book shows, tweaking even one habit, as long as it's the right one, can have staggering effects.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <b>The Power of Habit</b>, award-winning <i>New York Times </i>business reporter Charles Duhigg takes readers inside labs where brain scans record habits as they flourish and die; classrooms in which students learn to boost their willpower; and boardrooms where executives dream up products that tug on our deepest habitual urges. Full of compelling narratives that will appeal to fans of Michael Lewis, Jonah Lehrer, and Chip and Dan Heath, <b>The Power of Habit</b><i> </i>contains an exhilarating argument: our most basic actions are not the product of well-considered decision making, but of habits we often do not realize exist. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our lives.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Charles Duhigg</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What sparked your interest in habits? </strong></p> <p>A. I first became interested in the science of habits eight years ago, as a newspaper reporter in Baghdad, when I heard about an army major conducting an experiment in a small town named Kufa. The major had analyzed videotapes of riots and had found that violence was often preceded by a crowd of Iraqis gathering in a plaza and, over the course of hours, growing in size. Food vendors would show up, as well as spectators. Then, someone would throw a rock or a bottle.</p> <p>When the major met with Kufa&#x2019;s mayor, he made an odd request: Could they keep food vendors out of the plazas? Sure, the mayor said. A few weeks later, a small crowd gathered near the Great Mosque of Kufa. It grew in size. Some people started chanting angry slogans. At dusk, the crowd started getting restless and hungry. People looked for the kebab sellers normally filling the plaza, but there were none to be found. The spectators left. The chanters became dispirited. By 8 p.m., everyone was gone.</p> <p>I asked the major how he had figured out that removing food vendors would change peoples' behavior.</p> <p>The U.S. military, he told me, is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history. &#x201c;Understanding habits is the most important thing I&#x2019;ve learned in the army,&#x201d; he said. By the time I got back to the U.S., I was hooked on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Q. How have your own habits changed as a result of writing this book?</strong></p> <p>A. Since starting work on this book, I've lost about 30 pounds, I run every other morning (I'm training for the NY Marathon later this year), and I'm much more productive. And the reason why is because I've learned to diagnose my habits, and how to change them.</p> <p>Take, for instance, a bad habit I had of eating a cookie every afternoon. By learning how to analyze my habit, I figured out that the reason I walked to the cafeteria each day wasn't because I was craving a chocolate chip cookie. It was because I was craving socialization, the company of talking to my colleagues while munching. That was the habit's real reward. And the cue for my behavior - the trigger that caused me to automatically stand up and wander to the cafeteria, was a certain time of day.</p> <p>So, I reconstructed the habit: now, at about 3:30 each day, I absentmindedly stand up from my desk, look around for someone to talk with, and then gossip for about 10 minutes. I don't even think about it at this point. It's automatic. It's a habit. I haven't had a cookie in six months.</p> <p><strong>Q. What was the most surprising use of habits that you uncovered?</strong></p> <p>A. The most surprising thing I've learned is how companies use the science of habit formation to study - and influence - what we buy.</p> <p>Take, for example, Target, the giant retailer. Target collects all kinds of data on every shopper it can, including whether you&#x2019;re married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how much money you earn, if you've moved recently, the websites you visit. And with that information, it tries to diagnose each consumer&#x2019;s unique, individual habits.</p> <p>Why? Because Target knows that there are these certain moments when our habits become flexible. When we buy a new house, for instance, or get married or have a baby, our shopping habits are in flux. A well-timed coupon or advertisement can convince us to buy in a whole new way. But figuring out when someone is buying a house or getting married or having a baby is tough. And if you send the advertisement after the wedding or the baby arrives, it&#x2019;s usually too late.</p> <p>So Target studies our habits to see if they can predict major life events. And the company is very, very successful. Oftentimes, they know what is going on in someone's life better than that person's parents.</p>CHARLES DUHIGG is an investigative reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>.

The tent had been waterproofed with a mixture of paraffin and gasoline; in seconds it was burning out of control, and more than 8,000 people were trapped inside. Drawing on interviews with hundreds of survivors, O'Nan skillfully re-creates the horrific events and illuminates the psychological oddities of human behavior under stress: the mad scramble for the exits; the hero who tossed dozens of children to safety before being trampled to death. <br><br>Brilliantly constructed and exceptionally moving, <b>The Circus Fire</b> is history at its most compelling.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>As some 9,000 people watched the Wallendas begin their high-wire act on July 6, 1944, a fire started on the sidewall of the big top at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. The tent had been waterproofed with a mixture of 6,000 gallons of white gasoline and 18,000 pounds of paraffin; common practice for circuses at the time. In minutes, the entire tent was engulfed in flames. In the rush for the exits, people were trampled and burned--some beyond recognition. In the end, 167 were dead and 487 injured, of whom 140 required hospitalization. The city of Hartford, Connecticut, would never be the same. Stewart O'Nan brings his storytelling ability to the tragedy of <i>The Circus Fire</i>.<p> </p><blockquote> Several survivors said the one thing they will never forget about the circus fire as long as they live is the sound of the animals as they burned alive. But there were no animals. </blockquote><p> O'Nan interviewed dozens of witnesses and examined police reports, newspaper accounts, and court documents while researching the fire. The result is an engrossing--though agonizingly painful--account of the great fire and its aftermath. He probes the tragedy's enduring mysteries--How did the fire start? Who are the unidentified victims? Who is Little Miss 1565?--and offers up conclusions of his own. He also provides remarkable vignettes of panic, heroism, and grief: Merle Evans and the band playing "The Stars and Stripes Forever," the circus disaster march, over and over; Bill Curlee, standing atop the wild animal chute throwing trapped children to safety; the Cote sisters, who made it home safely then broke down when asked why they were back so early. O'Nan tells their stories with compassion--albeit with a slight tendency toward the macabre.</p><p> Moving, saddening, gruesome--yet car-crash compelling--<i>The Circus Fire</i> is a gripping read.

He knew it wouldn't come easy, but he was prepared to put in the work&#x2014;he spent his teenage years cycling an average of 400 miles per week. The dedication began to pay off. As an amateur, he represented his country and finished sixth in the World Championships. In 1986 he turned professional, and reality hit. He soon discovered it was not about glory and courage, nor about training or dedication. It was about grueling defeats, complete and utter exhaustion, and drugs&#x2014;not drugs that would ensure victory, but drugs that would allow you to finish the race.

It is the only firm surviving from pre-Treaty days (before the Treaty of Nanking which opened China to foreign commerce in 1842) and it played a very important part in that process. The firm soon after moved to the newly ceded colony of Hong Kong, and ever since the firm has been associated with the island. &#x2018;Jardines is Hong Kong&#x2019; someone once asserted to Lord Blake &#x2013; an exaggeration, of course, but pardonable. And although Hong Kong has reverted to Chinese sovereignty, Jardine Matheson is likely to remain a major feature of the place and may well play a renewed role in mainland China far into the twenty-first century.<p>Lord Blake traces the early beginnings of the firm, from William Jardine's first glimpse of Canton in 1802, through the rapid expansion and growth of the nineteenth century and into the next, leaving the story exactly half-way through the twentieth century, just as the Korean War breaks out. </p><p>The early history of the firm has always been regarded as the most interesting part of the story. It, or its background, has been the subject of two fascinating historical novels: the late James Clavell's bestselling blockbuster Tia-pan (1966) and Timothy Mo's aclaimed An Insular Possession (1986). The real story is equally exciting in the hands of one of the most distinguished historians of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Robert (Lord) Blake was Provost of the Queen&#39;s College Oxford 1968-87 and pro-Vice Chancellor, Oxford University 1971-87.

He was created a life peer in 1971.</p><h2>Our Queen</h2><p>Inside the world of Elizabeth II.<br><br>Throughout history, there has been no Monarch like her. She is not merely the oldest Sovereign England has ever known. She is the most worldly. She has travelled further than all her predecessors put together. She has met more historic figures than anyone alive -- from Churchill to Mandela, de Gaulle, Reagan and Obama. And today, Queen Elizabeth II is no more contemplating retirement than she was when she came to the throne in 1952. She sits at the head of a hereditary institution so often associated with rigid tradition. And yet, it is more dynamic now than ever.<br><br>Having inherited a quasi-Edwardian insitution nearly 600 years ago, the Queen presides over a Monarchy which has managed to remain, simultaneously, popular, regal, inclusive and relevant in a 21st Century world. She has done this so effectively that she is, beyond doubt, the most respected and popular figure in British public life.<br><br>As she reaches a defining moment of her reign -- her Diamond Jubliee -- Robert Hardman explores the secrets of the Queen's success to produce a fascinating new portrait of a Sovereign who has witnessed more change than any since the creation of Great Britain.</p><p>ROBERT HARDMAN has been writing about the Monarchy for more than 15 years, first as royal correspondent for <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>and now as the author of the "How I See It" column in the <i>Daily Mail</i>.

Almost all of us experience at least a mild depression from time to time and an estimated one-third of adults will experience a significant depression in their lifetime. </p><p>This workbook is designed to be used as part of your treatment with a psychotherapist or counselor. While you might find the worksheets are helpful at relieving your depression without additional help, seeing a qualified therapist or counselor will help you make much quicker progress in overcoming your depression.

A professional therapist or counselor will help you focus on the things you can do to get both immediate and long-term relief from your depression.</p><p>In the last twenty years, psychologists have started looking beyond just treating the symptoms of depression and have also focused their treatment on techniques that can help people find a happier and more fulfilling life. Many of the worksheets in this workbook are derived from research on why some people seem to be happier than others, and you may be surprised at how little it takes to make this happen.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Pursuit of God</h2><p><b>The Pursuit of God</b><br> <b>Aiden Wilson TOZER (1897 - 1963)</b><br><br> "As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God." <br>This thirst for an intimate relationship with God, claims A.W. Tozer, is not for a select few, but should be the experience of every follower of Christ. But, he asserts, it is all too rare when believers have become conditioned by tradition to accept standards of mediocrity, and the church struggles with formality and worldliness. Using examples from Scripture and from the lives of saints who lived with this thirst for God, Tozer sheds light on the path to a closer walk with God.</p><p>We are excited to be the new copyright owners of Tozer&#39;s classics. This new edition has been published with a beautiful new cover to reach a whole new generation of readers. Also available: God&#39;s Pursuit of Man, Tozer&#39;s profound prequel to The Pursuit of God.<b><i></i></b><i></i><p><i><b>A call to raise God to His rightful place</b></i></p><p>Sometimes the voice that speaks&nbsp;so clearly in the present is one that echoes from the past. So it is in this Christian classic by the late pastor and evangelist A. W. Tozer. He brings the mystics to bear on modern spirituality, grieving the hustle and bustle and calling for a slow, steady gaze upon God. With prophetic vigor and flowing prose, he urges us to replace low thoughts of God with lofty ones, to quiet our lives so we can know God's presence. He reminds us that life apart from God is really no life at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Tozer writes from his knees, a posture fit for presenting the character of God in all its demanding grandeur. "Arise, O sleeper!" is his word to us, and yet if we heed the call, we will see that to arise is not to stand but to kneel before the God of heaven in humble contemplation. To pursue God is to know Him, and in our knowing, be drawn in.</p></p><h2>All About Turtles</h2><p>From the author of the Crinkleroot series, a boldly illustrated picture book captures the traits and characteristics of land and sea turtles in their natural habitats.</p><p>Jim Arnosky was born on Sept. 1, 1946, in New York. After high school, he attended one year of trade school and then joined the US Navy. His intense love of the natural world led him to pursue a career as a wildlife artist. Today, Arnosky is the author and illustrator of 98 books about wildlife and nature for children. He has received numerous honors for his work, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science Lifetime Achievement Award for excellence in science illustration. Currently, he and his wife live in northern Vermont. <br>``Have you ever wondered about turtles?'' For readers who have wondered, this is an outstanding introduction. Arnosky provides a brief, informative text and beautiful, detailed full-color paintings with enormous appeal. He describes freshwater, salt water, and land-dwelling turtles, showing the differences in shell structure, patterns, anatomy, habitat, eggs, and diet. Only common names are given for the species illustrated, but many will be familiar. For example, freshwater turtles include the cooter, spotted, and painted turtles, while sea turtles depicted are the loggerhead, leatherback, and softshell. The author does not include size or range information. When specialized scientific language is used, the carefully placed drawings make clear what the author refers to. For example, drawings show the upper and lower turtle shell and are labeled ``carapace'' and ``plastron.'' There are also side views to help the reader tell a female turtle with convex plastron and the male turtle with concave plastron. Part of the ``All About'' series, this is an unusually appealing title by a fine science artist and author. Recommended with enthusiasm.

She is the author of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl&#x2019;s Christmas</i>, <i>Carl&#x2019;s Birthday</i> and <i>Carl&#x2019;s Snowy Afternoon</i>. Darling was born in 1941 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a large and close-knit family. Painting was a popular family recreation, and almost every family excursion included one or more easels and a variety of sketch pads, chalks, paints, and pencils. For four years, the family lived on a hundred-acre farm in Kentucky. Here young Sandra grew especially fond of riding and training horses, and became a dog owner for the first time. Living in the country also provided plenty of time for reading, a life-long passion. &nbsp;Sandra illustrated her first book in 1983: <i>The Teddy Bears' Picnic</i>, a popular children's song by Jimmy Kennedy. That same year, she was visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when she came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image proved the inspiration for <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the book's main character. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the seven sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients. &nbsp;About her work Sandra says: "I think that one of the reasons my illustrations have appealed to people is that they can sense my sincerity. I know that marvels exist which are just outside our ordinary experience, but that at any moment we may turn a corner and encounter one of them. Children also believe this, and because they and I have this conviction in common, we, as creator and audience, make good partners." Sandra lives in Seattle, Washington with her husband, Harold.Just when you thought Day had issued the dernier cri on the subject of Carl the capering canine (Carl's Afternoon in the Park , et al.), she tops herself by producing her most atmospheric book yet. Here, the rottweiler is bidden to mind the baby while the grown-ups attend a masquerade ball. Carl and baby, of course, tail the party-goers and join in the fun ("Oh! They must be Beauty and the Beast. Great costumes!" say the doorkeepers in one of the three spreads bearing text). Day has all but abandoned the small, multiple scenes used to convey a particular narrative development in the earlier Carl books--instead, settings are sumptuously evoked, fully peopled and lushly colored, packed with witty details (e.g., Carl and baby encounter a guest tricked out as Carl-and-baby; Carl and baby solve the problem of cutlery by feasting on popsicles; a bullfrog brass band keeps everyone hopping). Meanwhile, the party itself, with its site gaily festooned, its guests gotten up in magical guises and its many diversions, could be everybody's fantasy fiesta.

With an introduction by David Mitchell, author of the global phenomenon, <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, and translated by his wife, KA Yoshida.<br><br>Naoki Higashida was only a middle-schooler when he began to write <i>The Reason I Jump</i>. Autistic and with very low verbal fluency, Naoki used an alphabet grid to painstakingly spell out his answers to the questions he imagines others most often wonder about him: why do you talk so loud? Is it true you hate being touched? Would you like to be normal? The result is an inspiring, attitude-transforming book that will be embraced by anyone interested in understanding their fellow human beings, and by parents, caregivers, teachers, and friends of autistic children. Naoki examines issues as diverse and complex as self-harm, perceptions of time and beauty, and the challenges of communication, and in doing so, discredits the popular belief that autistic people are anti-social loners who lack empathy.&nbsp;<br><br>This book is mesmerizing proof that inside an autistic body is a mind as subtle, curious, and caring as anyone else's.</p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: David Mitchell and Andrew Solomon</b></p> <p><strong>David Mitchell is the international bestselling author of <em>Cloud Atlas</em> and four other novels.<br>Andrew Solomon is the author of several books including <em>Far From the Tree</em> and <em>The Noonday Demon</em>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Andrew Solomon: </strong>Why do you think that such narratives from inside autism are so rare--and what do you think allowed Naoki Higashida to find a voice?</p> <p><strong>David Mitchell: </strong>Autism comes in a bewildering and shifting array of shapes, severities, colors and sizes, as you of all writers know, Dr. Solomon, but the common denominator is a difficulty in communication. Naturally, this will impair the ability of a person with autism to compose narratives, for the same reason that deaf composers are thin on the ground, or blind portraitists. While not belittling the Herculean work Naoki and his tutors and parents did when he was learning to type, I also think he got a lucky genetic/neural break: the manifestation of Naoki's autism just happens to be of a type that (a) permitted a cogent communicator to develop behind his initial speechlessness, and (b) then did not entomb this communicator by preventing him from writing. This combination appears to be rare.</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>What, in your view, is the relationship between language and intelligence? How do autistic people who have no expressive language best manifest their intelligence?</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>It would be unwise to describe a relationship between two abstract nouns without having a decent intellectual grip on what those nouns are. Language, sure, the means by which we communicate: but intelligence is to definition what Teflon is to warm cooking oil. I feel most at home in the school that talks about 'intelligences' rather than intelligence in the singular, whereby intelligence is a fuzzy cluster of aptitudes: numerical, emotional, logical, abstract, artistic, 'common sense' &#x2013; and linguistic. In this model, language is one subset of intelligence &#x2013; and, Homo sapiens being the communicative, cooperative bunch that we are, rather a crucial one, for without linguistic intelligence it's hard to express (or even verify the existence of) the other types. I guess that people with autism who have no expressive language manifest their intelligence the same way you would if duct tape were put over your mouth and a 'Men in Black'-style memory zapper removed your ability to write: by identifying problems and solving them. I want a chocky bicky, but the cookie jar's too high: I'll get the stool and stand on it. Or, Dad's telling me I have to have my socks on before I can play on his iPhone, but I'd rather be barefoot: I'll pull the tops of my socks over my toes, so he can't say they aren't on, then I'll get the iPhone.

Do you think that the slightly self-mocking humor he shows will give him an easier life than he'd have had without the charm? </p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Definitely. Humor is a delightful sensation, and an antidote to many ills. I feel that it is linked to wisdom, but I'm neither wise nor funny enough to have ever worked out quite how they intertwine.</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>As you translated this book from the Japanese, did you feel you could represent his voice much as it was in his native language? Did you find that there are Japanese ways of thinking that required as much translation from you and your wife as autistic ways required of the author?</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Our goal was to write the book as Naoki would have done if he was a 13 year-old British kid with autism, rather than a 13 year-old Japanese kid with autism. Once we had identified that goal, many of the 1001 choices you make while translating became clear. Phrasal and lexical repetition is less of a vice in Japanese &#x2013;- it's almost a virtue &#x2013;- so varying Naoki's phrasing, while keeping the meaning, was a ball we had to keep our eyes on. Linguistic directness can come over as vulgar in Japanese, but this is more of a problem when Japanese is the Into language than when it is the Out Of language. The only other regular head-bender is the rendering of onomatopoeia, for which Japanese has a synaesthetic genius &#x2013; not just animal sounds, but qualities of light, or texture, or motion. Those puzzles were fun, though</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>Higashida has written dream-like stories that punctuate the narrative. Can you say what functional or narrative purpose they serve in the book?</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Their inclusion was, I guess, an idea of the book's original Japanese editor, for whom I can't speak. But for me they provide little coffee breaks from the Q&amp;A, as well as showing that Naoki can write creatively and in slightly different styles. The story at the end is an attempt to show us neurotypicals what it would feel like if we couldn't communicate. The story is, in a way, <em>The Reason I Jump</em> but re-framed and re-hung in fictional form. They also prove that Naoki is capable of metaphor and analogy.</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>The book came out in its original form in Japan some years ago. Do you know what has happened to the author since the book was published? </p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Naoki has had a number of other books about autism published in Japan, both prior to and after <em>Jump</em>. He's now about 20, and he's doing okay. He receives invitations to talk about autism at various universities and institutions throughout Japan. This involves him reading 2a presentation aloud, and taking questions from the audience, which he answers by typing. This isn't easy for him, but he usually manages okay. In terms of public knowledge about autism, Europe is a decade behind the States, and Japan's about a decade behind us, and Naoki would view his role as that of an autism advocate, to close that gap. (I happen to know that in a city the size of Hiroshima, of well over a million people, there isn't a single doctor qualified to give a diagnosis of autism.)</p><p>Naoki Higashida was born in 1992 and was diagnosed with autism at the age of five.

Narcissus bulbocodium or Narcissus cyclamineus? Isabellinus, iadinus, ianthinus? Basilaris or basilicus? Today&#39;s gardeners encounter Latin terms like these whenever they enter garden centres or pick up mail-order catalogues. They must still, of course, decide whether dahlias or peonies will best complete that floral border. But new questions in an increasingly technical vocabulary are sprouting up among perennial concerns and demanding attention from devoted gardeners. As Latin terms appear with increasing frequency in garden centres and on the pages of gardening catalogues, we need such brief, clear definitions for the finite number of Latin terms that combine to form the names of a seemingly infinite number of plant species. Equally welcome are the little-known horticultural facts and fables which fill the broad margins of every page. &#34;Gardener&#39;s Latin&#34; is a book for the gardener who needs to know that a plant with isabellinus (tawing yellow) on its nursery tag might not belong in a carefully planned ianthinus (violet-blue) border. Or that the ostensibly similar basilaris and basilicus mean &#39;base&#39; and &#39;royal&#39;, respectively. Bill Neal leads us down the path from abbreviatus to zonatus, turning aside here and there along the way for glimpses at gardens and gardeners from Virgil to Vita Sackville-West, from Gertrude Jekyll to Gertrude Stein. Patches of garden lore and literature are scattered throughout the beds of definition: why Narcissus cyclamineus is a horticultural joke; why basil is the herb of dread and suspicion; why Cleopatra&#39;s asp arrives in a basket of figs whenever &#34;Antony and Cleopatra&#34; is performed. Whether it&#39;s dahlias or peonies that will best complete a garden, &#34;Gardener&#39;s Latin&#34; is the book to complete any gardener&#39;s bookshelf.</p><p>BILL NEAL (1951-91) was widely admired as a chef and author of three cookbooks.

Nelson shows how consumer debt, both at the highest levels of finance and in the everyday lives of citizens, has time and again left us unable to make good.<b> </b>The problem always starts with<b> </b>the chain of banks, brokers, moneylenders, and insurance companies that separate borrowers and lenders. &nbsp;At a certain point lenders cannot tell good loans from bad&#x2014;and when chits are called in, lenders frantically try to unload the debts, hide from their own creditors, go into bankruptcy, and lobby state and federal institutions for relief. <br><br> With a historian&#x2019;s keen observations and a storyteller&#x2019;s nose for character and incident, Nelson captures the entire sweep of America&#x2019;s financial history in all its utter irrationality: national banks funded by smugglers; fistfights in Congress over the gold standard; and presidential campaigns forged in stinging controversies on the subject of private debt. <i>A Nation of Deadbeats </i>is a fresh, irreverent look at Americans&#x2019; addiction to debt and how it has made us what we are today.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p>SCOTT REYNOLDS NELSON is the author of, among other works, <i>Steel Drivin&#x2019; Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an American Legend, </i>which<i> </i>won the National Award for Arts Writing, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, the Merle Curti Award for best book in American social history, and the Library of Virginia Literary Award for nonfiction.

The shouting started outside William Duer&#x2019;s cell in the &#x201c;New Gaol,&#x201d; a debtors&#x2019; prison near the New York City commons at the northeast corner of what is now City Hall Park. A diverse crowd of three to five hundred &#x201c;disorderly persons&#x201d; had gathered there to confront him that evening, including cart men, artisans, and slaves. What began with shouts, catcalls, and a few stones tossed at the prison&#x2019;s windows soon escalated into an old-fashioned New York riot.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonel William Duer was nearly fifty, a small and delicate man born into a wealthy English family with plantations in the Anglo-Caribbean colonies of Antigua and Dominica. Educated at Eton, Duer had come to New York in 1768 searching for timber for his family&#x2019;s Dominican plantation. Seeing greater opportunities in New York, he had borrowed �1,400 from his sister and established himself the next year on a large plot of land along the Hudson River. With his charming wife, &#x201c;Lady Kitty,&#x201d; he had defied convention by dressing his servants in livery, creating a family crest of arms, and entertaining aristocrats in a fashionable town house one block north of Wall Street. As the Revolution began, he used his growing social network in New York to become a furnishing merchant, supplying timber, planks, and provisions to the Continental army. By 1780 he was worth more than �400,000, or nearly 2 million. After the Revolution, he had become a member of the powerful Board of Treasury under the Continental Congress, a government bond dealer, and a stock market trader.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on March 23, 1792, less than a month before the fracas outside, Duer had voluntarily entered the New Gaol to hide from his creditors. By ancient rules of bankruptcy that still applied in New York, debtors&#x2019; prisons were designed to shake money out of debtors, their friends, and their families. Duer&#x2019;s neighbors in the New Gaol included many who had overleveraged, but no one who had leveraged so much.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the height of the mayhem outside the prison, some in the crowd reportedly shouted, &#x201c;We will have Mr. Duer, he has gotten our money.&#x201d; Threatening to remove Duer bodily from his cell, the crowd began to throw paving stones, breaking windows and streetlamps. Well after dusk, &#x201c;friends of legal restraint and good order&#x201d; helped the city magistrates to arrest some of the most troublesome members of the crowd, including several artisans, the merchant John Hazard, and Tom, a slave owned by Joseph Towers. For the next few nights, crowds returned to the jail to threaten vengeance. The magistrate assigned Duer his own personal guard, though by the middle of April civil authorities and brick prison walls seemed little protection against a mob bent on repossessing the colonel&#x2019;s assets in this world and sending him to the next one.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time he entered prison, it was estimated that Duer, America&#x2019;s first famous deadbeat, had defaulted on promises worth more than $2 million. By some estimates this was more than half the nation&#x2019;s supply of readily available money. For though the American colonies had revolted against the English crown more than ten years earlier, capital, education, and power in America were still concentrated among a small group of insiders. Duer was at the center of this financial network, the man who hired the auctioneers who sold bonds in coffeehouses and shouted current prices from tree stumps on New York&#x2019;s Wall Street. When he placed a bid, every head turned to see which way his money was moving. In today&#x2019;s parlance, Duer was a market maker.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of March, Duer and his associates borrowed more than $800,000 to corner the market on U.S. bonds. Few understood that he had bet most of his fortune. When his credit got tight later that month, he had his assistants privately borrow gold and silver at high interest from many of New York&#x2019;s most unlikely lenders. &#x201c;Besides shopkeepers, Widows, [and] orphans,&#x201d; wrote his associate Seth Johnson, Duer owed &#x201c;Butchers, Car[t]men, Gardners, market women, &amp; even the noted Bawd Mrs. Macarty&#x2014;many of them if they are unpaid are ruined.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the sufferers outside the New Gaol, the nation&#x2019;s tiny financial elite&#x2014;men who spent their hours and their fortunes in the coffeehouses of Philadelphia, Boston, and New York&#x2014;faced financial ruin. Scores of Duer&#x2019;s merchant friends along the Eastern Seaboard had signed now-overdue promissory notes on faith under Colonel Duer&#x2019;s name. Most now rued the day they had ever met the man. Some disappeared into the western wilderness or crossed into Canada to escape Duer&#x2019;s fate.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By April all five branches of the newly established Bank of the United States had restricted lending. Lenders demanded immediate settlement in gold and silver. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to buoy the nation&#x2019;s tiny stock and securities market by buying back federal Treasuries, but few lenders were accepting anything but gold. In May interest rates on short-term loans approached 96 percent, or 8 percent per month. Soon there were rumors that creditors in Connecticut were demanding that Congress make good on Duer&#x2019;s debts. Many doubted if the new nation could survive its first financial crisis. But that is getting a bit ahead of the story.<br><br><b>How To Fund A Revolution?<br></b><br>After Americans and British troops began to exchange gunfire at Lexington and Concord in 1775, merchants with capital had to make a decision: support the Revolution or support the crown? Duer and a small group of New York and New England merchant adventurers with names like Roosevelt, Bleecker, Melvill, and Morris threw their financial backing behind the American partisans. They took enormous risks in challenging the British crown, but many of Duer&#x2019;s associates profited handsomely by providing high-interest loans to this newly formed government.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, Duer&#x2019;s support for the Revolution put his family in some danger. Indeed he hesitated to take an officer&#x2019;s commission because he feared it would lead the crown to seize the family&#x2019;s plantation in Antigua. Yet as a man with capital, he was in a position to demand a great deal. As companies mustered in New York and Boston, Duer promised provisions but demanded that Revolutionary quartermasters, colonels, treasurers, and comptrollers provide him with negotiable loans and letters of credit, promises of future payment that he could sell to international capitalists in France and Amsterdam. These were the new nation&#x2019;s first debts, and most of them passed through Duer&#x2019;s hands. Of course Duer paid his fellow <i>colonists</i> in depreciated colonial currencies when he bought their timber, muskets, and provisions for the Continental armies.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the man who profited from the nation&#x2019;s debts, Duer had few friends and a host of enemies. Depending on where you stood, men like Duer were either the merchant financiers who had funded the American cause or the speculators who had nearly squeezed the Revolution dry. Those standing outside Duer&#x2019;s jail cell in April 1792 were inclined to see him as the devil in human form. As the Boston <i>Argus</i> noted, Duer had long been a swindler who &#x201c;laughs at the calamity he has brought upon his country; while the bloodsucking brokers in his employ are still hovering round us like <i>Milton&#x2019;s devils</i>, pimping, soothing, and promising redress without any intention . . . of ever performing.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men like Duer were not unfamiliar, even in colonial America. Merchant capitalists like Duer had been secretly doing business with foreign powers for generations. Indeed their covert trading with Dutch, French, and Spanish sea captains had much to do with the crown&#x2019;s imposition of financial regulations that helped cause the Revolution. After the colonies challenged Britain&#x2019;s authority to tax their trade, the hastily created Continental Congress called on militia to assemble. It failed, however, to properly fund the operation. In the past, the colonies had parsimoniously issued small quantities of their own currency, but during the Revolutionary struggle they turned to the printing press, printing unbacked currency to fight the British.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duer and his friends understood that the colonies in revolt had no currency and banking infrastructure compared with their English opponents. In Britain and much of Europe, printed currencies were strictly regulated by agents of kings and bore the seal of the monarch. For more than one hundred years before the Revolution, colonial currencies changed hands in America, but they were frequently declared illegal by Britain. The value of these colonial currencies rested on either export goods or land. Thus Virginia&#x2019;s first printed banknote was a tobacco receipt issued by the colony&#x2019;s inspection station in Richmond: the state&#x2019;s pledge to pay gold or silver for tobacco deposited in its warehouse. Regular in form and difficult to reproduce, these receipts appealed to Virginians as replacements for scarce gold and silver. To keep up their value, Virginia&#x2019;s treasurer promised to destroy them when Virginians turned them in for taxes (sometimes he didn&#x2019;t). Within a generation Virginia&#x2019;s fledgling private banks held these tobacco receipts in their vaults and issued their own banknotes on their security, a pledge on a pledge. Likewise, New England banks chartered by colonial assemblies took mortgages for land borrowed, bought, or stolen from Indians, giving out currency that was payable for taxes. Even before the colonies declared themselves separate nations, they covertly assumed the rights of European sovereigns to make the pledges that became printed money. Colonial currencies were America&#x2019;s first symbolic promises, promises about future tobacco sales, future land values, and the future prospect of property taxes. Imprinting colonial currencies with engravings of painted Indians, tobacco leaves, sailing ships, and sturdy pioneers simply made the metaphor concrete.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting a revolution allowed the colonies to gradually become sovereign in a process both military and monetary. As the battles moved along the Eastern Seaboard, the colonies and their Continental Congress claimed the sovereign power to issue state and national currency to pay for food, guns, and gunpowder. Americans with guns and gunpowder would in turn make their states sovereign by force of arms; sovereign states would then accept their own currency for taxes and unsettled land. As go-betweens in America&#x2019;s first promises, Duer and his friends had their doubts about this circular process of using currency to buy arms to guarantee currency; they speculated in state currencies but refused to take them as payment for the goods they provided. They preferred handwritten promises of future payment: bonds, not currency.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Duer and his friends predicted, the value of these state currencies fluctuated wildly depending on how the battle with England was progressing, how careful each state was in issuing its notes, and how large its population of currency holders was. In the final analysis, most Americans saw currency for what it was: a measure of the value of land the states claimed but that remained untilled in their Westerly reaches, land that states would sell once the shooting stopped. Big colonies had a vast blank check in their thousands of acres of unsurveyed western land. Little colonies had nothing. Rhode Island paper was worthless; Massachusetts notes were respectable; free-spending but well-endowed Virginia was somewhere in between.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the colonies came together to create the Continental Congress to oversee the fighting of the war, the Congress issued its own currency as well. As a &#x201c;congress&#x201d; of independent states rather than a parliament, it had no sovereignty, no direct claim to western land or taxes. The Congress expected that the member states would tax their own lands and then pay the Congress a sum proportional to their population. As it became clear that some states would not pay the debts incurred in the fighting, the value of the Continental dollars plunged after the autumn of 1776. &#x201c;It is true,&#x201d; wrote the editor of the <i>Pennsylvania Evening Post</i>, &#x201c;that those rags after having gone thro[ugh] a certain mysterious process of <i>transubstantiation</i>, under the sanction of Congress are said to be money . . . but since that Popish doctrine with a long name is exploded, and the funds for redeeming these nominal dollars are in the moon, no man but a lunatic will . . . believe that billets of brown paper can really be dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As General Washington&#x2019;s troops suffered for provisions, the Congress tried to prop federal dollars up by authorizing the army to seize the assets of grocers and farmers who refused to take them. The expression &#x201c;not worth a Continental dollar&#x201d; became a catchphrase that traveled more widely than the notes did. To make matters worse, the British general Henry Clinton learned to take advantage of the rebels&#x2019; wartime dependence on paper promises. To simultaneously make money for himself and destabilize the colonial economy, he set up tavern agents to sell knockoffs of American currency for pennies a sheet to unscrupulous buyers.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duer and many of his friends understood that banknotes issued by states or the Continental Congress were not nearly as reliable as the promises made to foreign states. Indeed, as the fighting continued in 1780, Congress passed the infamous Forty-for-One Act, declaring that it would pay only a dollar in silver for forty continentals. This was hyperinflation of the worst kind. As Revolutionaries like Thomas Paine pointed out, rapid currency inflation was a tax on the poor: the poorest Americans were paid in currency, bought goods with currency, and saved currency that was constantly dropping in value. Rather than hold cash, Duer hoarded assets that appreciated in wartime: gold, silver, timber, or wheat. He especially sought promises that came from across the ocean or promises that could be sold there.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duer&#x2019;s most spectacular gains came in supplying America&#x2019;s French allies. By agreeing to split his proceeds with requisitioning officers, Duer won lucrative contracts in provisioning French armies and navies. Because he paid with bills of exchange that originated in Paris, he had marketable promises when few others did. He could buy English and Dutch goods with substantial Paris bills, trade those goods for provisions in New York, then charge French forces for the New York provisions, earning what he called &#x201c;double profits.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the fighting between 1776 and 1783, many American promises were made, but few were paid. Courts and legislatures suspended the collection of public and private debts. A few states took strategic advantage of the chaos to favor debtors: North Carolina and New York seized the property of loyalists and forced English creditors to accept the states&#x2019; depreciated banknotes for it; South Carolina made English creditors ac...</p><h2>Sirens &amp; Sinners: A Visual History of Weimar Film 1918-1933</h2><p><p><strong>Celebrates the height of Weimar cinema through images and commentaries on more than seventy of its finest films</strong></p> Between the First and Second World Wars, Germany under the Weimar Republic was the scene of one of the most creative periods in film history.

The victim worked for the powerful mine owner, Walter Knapman, and the motive seems to be sabotaging Walter&#x2019;s business. But the tinners have their own laws, and they are none too pleased at Crowner John&#x2019;s interference. And then Walter Knapman disappears. Only Gwyn, Crowner John&#x2019;s right-hand man, seems to be of any help until he&#x2019;s arrested for murder and put on trial for his life.</p><p>Professor Bernard Knight, CBE, became a Home Office Pathologist in 1965 and was appointed Professor of Forensic Pathology, University of Wales College of Medicine, in 1980. During his 40-year career with the Home Office, he performed over 25,000 autopsies, and was involved in many high profile cases, including that of Fred and Rose West, and the child killer, Mary Bell. The author of numerous popular and academic non-fiction books, he has written thirteen novels in the Crowner John mystery series. Professor Knight lives in Cardiff.<b>Chapter One: In which Crowner John is harangued by his wife</b><br>The last thing that Sir John de Wolfe needed this morning was another argument with his wife. He arrived back at his home in Martin's Lane at about the tenth hour, as the nearby cathedral bell was tolling for Terce, Sext and Nones. He left his great stallion Odin with the farrier opposite, then trudged across the narrow road and bent his black head to enter the front door. As he slumped on to the bench in the vestibule to pull off his dusty riding boots, a strident voice called out from the hall to his left: "John! Is that you, John?"<br>Suppressing an urge to reply that it was the Archangel Gabriel come to whisk her up to heaven, de Wolfe yelled back that it was indeed himself and that he was hungry enough to eat a small horse, shoes and all. Before he could summon up the will to go in to meet Matilda, a large hound loped up the covered passage that led from the backyard to the vestibule and laid its slobbering mouth affectionately across his knees. As he fondled old Brutus's ears, Mary the housemaid appeared and, keeping a wary eye on the inner door to the hall, planted a drier pair of lips quickly on his cheek. "She's in a funny mood today, Sir Crowner," she whispered. Mary was a handsome, dark-haired woman of about twenty-five and John felt that he would probably not survive without her: Mary kept him fed and in clean garments, while his wife was seemingly oblivious of his basic needs. She spent most of her time in church.<br>"Matilda's always in a funny mood," he growled, as the servant handed him a pair of soft house shoes.<br>"Her brother was here earlier this morning," she murmured. "They seemed to be hatching some plot, but I couldn't hear what they said."<br>She threw his grey wolfskin cloak over her arm and moved towards the covered passage back to her domain in the yard. "I'll beat the dust out of this. Do you need anything to eat now?"<br>The coroner shook his head. "Just a jug of ale. I broke my fast in Crediton soon after dawn."<br>He had ridden the day before to Rackenford, a village up towards Exmoor, to hold an inquest on a youth crushed by a collapsed wall. He had left there too late to get back to Exeter before the gates were closed at curfew and had had to spend the night in the hall of a manor near Crediton.<br>As she was about to vanish down the passage, Mary put her head round the corner for a last word. "From what I heard, she's on again about you being away so much."<br>De Wolfe groaned as he rose stiffly to his feet. Matilda was like a dog worrying at a bone, with her never-ending complaints about his frequent absences, even though it was she who, last September, had nagged him to take this damned job as Devon's county coroner. Now, he lifted the heavy iron latch on the inner door and went between the draught screens into the hall. His house was a tall, narrow building, one of three side by side in Martin's Lane, which led from Exeter's main street into the cathedral Close. Opposite was the farrier's forge and stable, which was between the pine end of an alehouse in the high street and St Martin's Church.<br>The gloomy hall into which he now stepped occupied most of the house, rising up to the smoke-darkened roof timbers. Two shuttered windows faced the street, with oiled linen screens across the inside, which let in a little light. Though most of the house was of wood, the back wall was of stone. De Wolfe had had that built a few years back, to allow a large hearth to be constructed, with a new-fangled conical chimney to take the smoke outside. Before, the choking fumes from a hearth-pit in the middle of the floor had had to find their way out through the eaves. The other walls were hung with sombre tapestries to cover the rough planks, and just behind the screens, his chain-mail hauberk and round iron helmet were strung from iron hooks alongside his battered shield with its emblem of a snarling wolf's head in black on a white ground.<br>De Wolfe shut the door behind him and walked reluctantly towards the fire, past the heavy oaken table flanked by benches. His feet slapped against the cold flagstones, an innovation demanded by his wife, who considered the usual rushes over beaten earth fit only for peasants. Brutus had slunk in craftily with him and now made for the hearth. He lay down with his face on his paws before a heap of glowing logs. His nose was almost on a pair of embroidered shoes, whose owner was sitting on a settle on the further side of the fireplace.<br>"Out all night again, sir! I wonder what trollop suffered your favours this time?" Matilda's voice was vibrant, almost harsh, her thin-lipped mouth a slash across her square face. She sat bolt upright, her small eyes glaring at him from above the furrowed half-circles of lax skin that hung below the lower lids. Her sparse fair hair had been tortured into tight ringlets with hot tongs wielded by her French maid Lucille, and was further confined by a cap of silvered mesh squeezed over her head. She wore a long gown of blue wool over her stocky figure, covered by a surcoat of the same colour with a rabbit-fur collar against the draughts of early April.<br>Her husband ignored the taunt until he had sat down in a cowled monk's chair set on the opposite side of the hearth. "As it happens, Matilda, I spent the night wrapped in my cloak, on the floor of de Warren's hall in Crediton. And for sleeping companions, I had Gwyn, Thomas and half a dozen of de Warren's servants. At least there was a good fire there and a decent meal before we left."<br>Not put off her stride by his measured response, Matilda continued her attack. "You've been out of this house and my bed three nights this week, John. And last month, you were away for days on end, carousing about the north of the county, claiming that you were chasing pirates."<br>"Your own brother was with me then, with twenty of his men-at-arms, so I had little chance of carousing."<br>She ignored this, and ranted on in full spate. "I might as well have stayed a spinster as bother to get married to you. I hardly saw you for the first thirteen years after we were wed."<br>His sigh of resignation was interrupted by Mary, who bustled in with a stoneware jug of ale and a pint pot, which she set on the edge of the hearth. While her back was turned to her mistress, she winked at him, bobbed her head and hurried out.<br>"I seem to have heard all this before, wife," de Wolfe answered mildly, pouring himself some ale.<br>"And you'll hear it again, until you see some sense," retorted Matilda. "I've been talking to Richard and we agree that something must be done."<br>He took a deep draught of the sour ale and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "You're the one who wanted me to become coroner -- and you've complained ever since."<br>His wife's mouth clamped shut like a vice and she glared at him across the width of the great hearth. "I wanted you to become <i>a</i> coroner, not <i>the</i> coroner!" she grated. "Your precious friend the Chief Justiciar proclaimed that three knights in every county were to be appointed -- not just one!"<br>De Wolfe shrugged. "We couldn't find three in Devon. You know as well as I do that Robert Fitzrogo was also appointed, but within a fortnight the damned fool had fallen from his horse and been killed. Since then, I've been stuck with the whole job, except when I was laid up with my broken leg."<br>"And that showed you weren't indispensable," she flashed triumphantly. "For six weeks, the county got on quite well without you. You use all this traipsing about as an excuse for visiting aleshops and bawdy-houses. Well, this drinking and wenching will have to stop. Richard and I have decided upon it."<br>It was de Wolfe's turn to sit bolt upright -- in sheer indignation. "You and your bloody brother have decided, have you? I presume it's too much to ask what you and our dear sheriff have arranged for me?"<br>Matilda leaned forward, her prominent jaw jutting pugnaciously at him. "We've found another candidate for coroner -- not making the full three, but certainly two are better than a solitary one. It will help keep you at home at nights."<br>De Wolfe scowled at her over the brim of his pot. "You've found a new coroner? I thought that was the job of the King's justices -- not a provincial sheriff and his sister!"<br>His sarcasm was lost on Matilda, who now had the bit firmly between her teeth. "Don't you want to know who we found?" she demanded.<br>John grunted, staring suspiciously at her over his ale.<br>"Theobald Fitz-Ivo!" she cried triumphantly.<br>His eyes widened in scornful astonishment. "Ha! Not that drunken old fart from Frithelstock? He couldn't investigate a penny lost in a privy!"<br>His wife bridled at his scornful response. "Beggars can't be choosers -- you need help and he lives in just the right place, near Torrington. He could cover the north of the county and leave the rest to you. God knows, that's more than enough for one man, all of Dartmoor and the south and east."<br>De Wolfe jumped up and paced back and forth in front of the hearth, waving his ale mug. "He must be well over fifty, fat and unfit. The man's useless, he drinks like a fish. His manor, small though it is, depends entirely on his bailiff."<br>"He must be doing well enough -- a coroner has to have at least twenty pounds a year to be eligible and he's proved more than that to Richard. And Richard should know -- he has to collect the taxes."<br>If de Wolfe had not been so incensed about Fitz-Ivo, he might have taken the opportunity to suggest that not all the taxes the sheriff collected from the county ever reached the royal treasure chest in Winchester. "Theobald is a lazy, incompetent fool, who is almost too fat to get astride a horse, let alone travel the county like I do. And where's he going to get a clerk who can read and write well enough to keep the coroner's rolls, eh?"<br>Matilda shrugged her thick shoulders. "You can ask Richard. He's coming to dinner to talk about it."<br>De Wolfe groaned again. After a day away, an uncomfortable night sleeping on a floor and ten miles on horseback since dawn, the last thing he needed was the company of his odious brother-in-law at the midday meal. He sat down again and supped his ale silently, thinking what a disaster it had been for his late father, Simon, to insist on his marrying into the de Revelle family. It may have prodded him up one rung on the ladder of Devon county aristocracy and into a richer family than his own, but at what price?<br>That had been sixteen years ago, though John had managed to stay away from home for most of that time, in the French and Irish wars and later at the Third Crusade. But since coming home two years ago, soon after King Richard had been captured in Austria, he had found no excuse for chasing off to war. He had settled uneasily to his role as a gentleman of leisure, his income assured by his investment in a wool export business with Hugh de Relaga, one of Exeter's most prominent burgesses, and by a share in the profit from the manors of his own family in the south of the county.<br>When the ambitious Matilda had suggested to her brother last autumn that her husband should be nominated as one of the new coroners, de Wolfe had been lukewarm about the idea. But Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury and Chief Justiciar of England, had welcomed him to the post with open arms -- as had the Lionheart when he was told of it in Normandy. De Wolfe had been a staunch member of the King's bodyguard in the Holy Land, where Hubert Walter had been left in military charge after Richard had sailed away on his disastrous voyage home. John had been with the King, and always blamed himself for his failure to prevent the capture of his monarch near Vienna - a dEb?cle that had plunged England into years of debt after she had raised a hundred and fifty thousand marks for his ransom.<br>As de Wolfe sat gloomily before the fire, staring into the flames while replaying these events in his mind, his wife regarded him steadily through cold eyes. She, too, regretted her marriage, wishing more strongly every day that she had entered a nunnery. As the disappointments of life mounted with every passing year, she found increasing solace in worshipping God. She had discovered early in her marriage that she disliked almost every aspect of her wifely duties, from going to the market to the expected humiliation in bed. Yet she still had the urge for social advancement, drilled into her by her mother, who had single-mindedly schemed towards the best matches for her three children. She had managed to marry her son Richard off to Lady Eleanor de Clavelle, who was distantly related to the great Mortimer dynasty, and was satisfied, too, with the deal she had struck with Simon de Wolfe for his son to marry Matilda, even though John was six years younger.<br>The de Wolfes had two manors near the coast, at Stoke-in-Teignhead and Holcombe, and both Matilda and her late mother had hoped that the warrior John might rise high in the service of the King. That ambition peaked with the Lionheart's capture when John returned home, exhausted and disillusioned. At forty it was not easy to find a war to fight, so he had been persuaded to accept the coroner's appointment -- especially as his beloved king and Hubert Walter were keen for him to take it.<br>Now Matilda looked at this long dark man, brooding at her fireside -- and wondered if she had ever really known him. Unusually tall and spare, he was slightly stooped, and gave most men the impression that he was hovering over them. His long black hair, which curled down on to his neck, framed a somewhat morose, saturnine face with bushy jet eyebrows and a great hooked nose. He had no beard or moustache, but always had a dark stubble between his weekly shaves. He dressed in nothing but black or grey, which, with his great crow's head, had long earned him the nickname "Black John" in the armies.<br>Now, he was hunched over the fire, his mind somewhere on the battlefields of Palestine or Ireland, and Matilda found it hard to believe that she had ever loved him. Maybe the transient affection she had felt for him sixteen years ago had been a hysterical self-deception whipped up by her mother's persuasive tongue. Within a month he had left her for the French campaigns and in the succeeding thirteen years he had been at home for little more than twelve months. Their love-life had been a disaster and thankfully, as far as she was concerned, their infrequent and embarrassing couplings had not resulted in children. Yet he was a passionate man, as his rather full lips suggested, and Matilda was well aware of his healthy sexual appetite, which he satisfied with a succession of mistresses, of whom the latest was that Welsh whore down at the Bush Inn.<br>Almost as if reading her thoughts, her husband suddenly rose to his feet. "I have to go to my chamber at the castle," he said gruffly. "There may have been deaths reported since I left yesterday." He felt an overwhelming desire to get out into the air again, away from her glowering presence.<br>"Are you sure that it's to Rougement you're going?" she sneered. "Not down to that alehouse in Idle Lane?"<br>Her accurate deduction so nettled him that he altered his plans just to confound her. "I said the castle and that's where I'll be. I'll even call on that scheming brother of yours and bring him back to our table."<br>Feeling self-righteous, even though he had deprived himself of a visit to Nesta, his mistress, he stalked out, taking a short mantle and street shoes from the vestibule before he stepped into the street. A moment later, he rapped on the outside of the window shutters as a defiant signal that he was turning left towards the high street, rather than right for the Bush Inn.<br>There was indeed news of a fresh death to be investigated when de Wolfe reached his o...</p><h2>The World of Music According to Starker</h2><p><p>"Few cello players currently before the public have enjoyed the kind of international success in all conceivable musical career roles as Janos Starker.

In this morally courageous book, Geo Stone sets out to diminish the lack of awareness about suicide, from the tragedy of teenage suicide to the debate over assisted suicide.</p><p>I place suicide attempters in one of four groups: (1) Rational people facing an insoluble problem, generally a fatal or debilitating illness; (2) Impulsive people, frequently young, truly but temporarily miserable, sometimes drunk, who wouldn't even consider suicide six months later; (3) Irrational people, often chronically alcoholic, schizophrenic, or depressed; (4) People trying to make a safe gesture as a "cry for help" or to get someone's attention. <p>The first group---and most of us will eventually be in it---has, in my view, the right to decide the time, place, and manner of their death. It is clear that a competent person who really wants to kill him- or herself can almost always do so. However, seriously ill or physically impaired people often have both the greatest interest in, and least ability to carry out, suicide. I believe that they ought to have medical help to die peacefully and without pain if they so choose; but this, while sometimes surreptitiously done, cannot at present be relied on. </p><p>Many of us have known people who have suffered long, agonizing deaths because they became too ill to kill themselves and their physicians were unwilling to act on their request. I will not mince words by calling it "euthanasia" or "self-deliverance": if you're terminally ill, I hope to provide you with information that will help you determine the best way to kill yourself, if that's your well-considered decision. </p><p>What about the young and impulsive, particularly teenagers? At the moment, they seem to have the worst of all worlds, where: (1) lethal and not-so-lethal suicide methods are readily available; (2) neither they, their parents, nor their teachers are likely to know how dangerous particular methods are; (3) personal ("Are you thinking about...?) or practical ("How would you go about...?) discussion of suicide is largely taboo. </p><p>While many schools now teach about AIDS and its transmission, many more teenagers will attempt or commit suicide next year than will become HIV-infected. The ignorance, stigma, and fear about suicide would decrease if that topic were added to the curriculum and treated honestly. </p><p>What of "irrational" people? They too face a lack of information on suicide methods. Will they sit down and read a book before acting and will they choose more (or less) lethal methods as a result? No one knows. The most relevant data show that in the year after the publication of an earlier suicide-methods book, "Final Exit" there was a small increase in the number of people using the book's recommended methods (from 3477 to 3751), but a small decrease in the overall number of suicides (from 30,906 to 30,810). This is consistent with the notion that "Final Exit" merely shifted the method used by about one percent of suicides; but it can't resolve the possibility that the overall number of suicides would have decreased without the "recommended methods" increase. </p><p>As for the fourth group, those trying to carry out a "safe" suicidal gesture, the information in this book can only be beneficial. </p><p>A case will be made that people shouldn't commit suicide and that, therefore, a manual telling them how to go about it is pernicious. This is like one of the arguments against sex education: "If they know how, they'll do it." Well, they do it anyway. Thirty thousand suicide deaths a year in the U.S. should make this clear. In the absence of knowledge about suicide methods---and the consequences of failed attempts---people will continue to act in desperation and ignorance, as they have throughout recorded history, with gun, rope, blade, poison, and anything else available. That is the reality. And the methods people use all too often leave them neither dead nor fully recovered, but maimed and permanently injured: paralyzed from jumps, brain-damaged from gunshots, comatose from drugs. </p><p>But for anyone considering suicide (or even "safe" suicidal gestures; nothing is 100 percent reliable), I urge you to try every alternative first---and then try them again. These include a variety of anti-depressant drug therapies, various flavors of psychotherapy, electroshock, and "reality therapy"---helping people worse off than you. Each of these will work for some; no single solution will work for everyone. That's why it's vital not to give up if one or two or three don't do much to decrease your pain. How do you know that suicide is the best solution if you haven't tried everything else first? You can always kill yourself later.</p>From Part I: Background ...Ironically, this well-intentioned and humanitarian opposition to suicide eventually degenerated into "...legalized and sanctified atrocities, by which the body of the suicide was degraded, his memory defamed, his family persecuted." Suicides were buried at crossroads with a stake through their bodies, and their property confiscated by the State. Perhaps the ultimate irony was the execution of people for the crime of attempting to commit suicide... <p>...More recently, with the advent of "anti-psychosis" drugs, such as Thorazine, in the 1950s, the concept of a biochemical basis for behavior has become increasingly persuasive. </p><p>One of the effects of these changes has been to largely remove suicide from the category of "moral crime." Instead, the fault has been shifted onto society, mental illness, or biochemical imbalance, things for which an individual can hardly be blamed. </p><p>Thus, if suicide is involuntary and beyond an individual's control, rational or moral arguments against it will be useless. The only moral question, then, will be that of intervention, abstention, or assistance by individuals or society-at-large... </p><p>...One of the ironies of suicide is that a suicide attempt--if survived--is probably the most dramatic and convincing way to draw attention to a problem and get help. Often family, psychiatric, and social service resources become suddenly available. A survey of Swiss survivors found that a majority felt that their actions had positive consequences for them. In Erwin Stengel's words, "The suicidal attempt is a highly effective though hazardous way of influencing others and its effects are as a rule...lasting." </p><p>...One of the ironic and presumably unintended results of making assisted suicide illegal is the pressure it puts on the old, infirm, and ill to kill themselves while they are still able to do so, and sooner than they would if they could count on help... </p><p>...This is a truly bizarre situation: EVERY study I've seen finds pain seriously undertreated; EVERY expert recommends more use of pain medications. Yet the problem persists. </p><p>Thus, Dr. Cundiff believes, with considerable justification, "We don't need a law to legalize assisted suicide, we need a law to teach doctors how to treat pain." </p><p>...There are two related practical problems with assisted suicide: (1) in most places it's illegal; (2) in many cases the job is bungled. As a result, end-of-life discussion between patient and doctor is often inhibited: physicians fear prosecution; patients fear involuntary commitment and deprivation of pain medication. The result is, all too often, badly-informed decisions badly carried out... </p><p>From Part II: Methods </p><p>Cutting/stabbing looks like one of the safer methods for a suicidal gesture because it has the lowest fatality rate, 4.1% - 5.8%...However, as mentioned earlier, all these data combine people intending to die with those wanting help or attention. </p><p>...Cuts on the wrist, and to a much lesser extent elbow or ankle, are often used to make a suicidal gesture. Such wrist cuts are generally shallow and perpendicular to the long bones of the forearm. They tend to sever the surface veins. Since these veins are neither particularly large nor carry as much pressure as the arteries, such cuts are not usually life-threatening because they can clot before a fatal quantity of blood is lost. </p><p>Wrist cuts become more dangerous: </p><p>(1) if the cuts are more-or-less parallel to the long bones. In such cases the blood vessels tend to be sliced lengthwise or diagonally, making clotting more difficult and thus allowing more and faster blood loss. </p><p>(2) if cuts are deeper and near the long bones of the forearm (the thumb-side long bone is the radius; the other long bone is the ulna), they may sever the radial artery or the ulnar artery. These pieces of plumbing ARE under high pressure, and cutting them can be fatal unless the bleeding is actively stanched. </p><p>There are claims that a single cut across a healthy wrist artery is not dangerous, because the cut artery (which, unlike veins, has built-in muscle) will contract and so limit blood loss. While this protective mechanism does exist, it's not always sufficient: four of the forty Stockholm deaths due to cuts on the limbs were from just such an injury; </p><p>You can find (or usually avoid) these arteries by checking various points around your wrist for a pulse. Without a stethoscope you will only detect one in a couple of spots, e.g., where your wrist and thumb come together. You can locate the radial artery fairly near the surface there. The other major wrist artery, the ulnar, runs parallel to the other forearm bone and can be felt near the heel of the hand. </p><p>Hyperextending the wrist is common, but hides the radial artery around the end of the radius (try feeling for the pulse), and one may end up with only severed flexor tendons. </p><p>...You may prefer to use an ankle vein in order to avoid wrist scars, and subsequent tedious cocktail-party conversation... </p><p>(3) if cuts are numerous. Multiple cuts of wrists, elbows, and ankles, none individually dangerous, may cause enough blood loss to be fatal. </p><p>(4) if clotting is inhibited. This may be deliberately done by keeping the cut under water. Another way to slow clotting is with drugs. Some drugs, like heparin and coumarin-like compounds [footnote], are prescribed specifically to decrease blood clotting in medical conditions like stroke. With other drugs, the anti-clotting ability is usually considered a "side effect" to its intended therapeutic use. Aspirin, when taken for pain relief, is the most common drug of this sort. Since many people are not aware of these effects, use of such drugs may occasionally turn a suicidal gesture into an accidental suicide... </p><p>...As methods of suicide, cutting and stabbing have little to recommend them: compared to lower-trauma asphyxias (see "Hanging" and "Asphyxia" chapters) they are, generally, more painful, and no faster or more reliable. Their major advantage is that (depending on site and method) you may, after the injury, have some time to change your mind.</p></p><h2>My Fairy Garden</h2><p><p>A 3D carousel fairy garden with press-out figures.

Thousands of churches are currently fine-tuning their worship services to make them more attractive and compelling. The typical church labors to integrate numerous programs, classes, and other offerings into its menu of possibilities. Millions of dollars flow from church budgets into events each year in an effort to influence people&#x2019;s thinking and behavior. Literally billions of dollars are spent every year maintaining, upgrading, and expanding buildings and facilities to provide the space and equipment required for the ministries planned by the church. To appeal to&nbsp;people who have thus far turned a cold shoulder to God, churches and denominations launch sophisticated marketing campaigns that are designed to reposition churches and raise awareness of the things of God.<br><br>All of those activities can be justified by their intent and outcomes. But here&#x2019;s a better strategy: <i>Ignite people&#x2019;s passion for God and get out of their way.</i> When individuals are single-minded in their devotion to God, their commitment to His ways and His principles becomes much deeper, much more intense. Once they have made an enduring and serious commitment, the peripherals don&#x2019;t matter as much. They&#x2019;ll endure worship services that may not meet their exact specifications because their focus is on God, not themselves. They&#x2019;ll attend activities at times that are not optimally convenient because the most important reality is to experience God&#x2019;s presence. They will sacrifice more of their hard-earned money for the purposes of ministry because they recognize that they are stewards, not owners. They will gladly share their faith in Christ with nonbelievers because they understand their responsibility to other people and to God, and because they simply cannot contain their own excitement about the privilege of relating to God.<br><br><b>REDEFINING MINISTRY SUCCESS<br></b><br>When you talk to pastors, church staff, and lay leaders across the nation you quickly discover that churches work hard to increase attendance figures, to provide a full range of programs, and to have adequate facilities to support a broad-based, inclusive ministry.

On the frontier, the process of forging sovereignty and citizens was stripped down to its essence. Settlers struggled with the very stuff of revolution: violence, uncertainty, disorder, and the frenzied competition to remake the fabric of society. In so doing, they were transformed from deferential subjects to self-sovereign citizens as the British Empire gave way to the American nation. But something more fundamental was at work. The violent nature of the contest to reconstitute sovereignty produced a revolutionary settlement in which race and citizenship went hand in hand. The common people demanded as much, and the state delivered. As westerners contended in a Hobbesian world, they also created some of the myths that made America American.<br>&nbsp;<br>Patrick Griffin recaptures a chaotic world of settlers, Indians, speculators, British regulars, and American and state officials, vying with one another to remake the West during its most formative period.</p><p><b>Patrick Griffin </b>is associate professor of history at the University of Virginia.Introduction&nbsp;Tom Quick&#x2019;s Monument&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Seven Years&#x2019; War through the American Revolution and until the Whiskey Rebellion, a frontiersman haunted the American imagination. Growing up on the Pennsylvania frontier as the eldest of ten, Tom Quick was one of those faceless, poorer men squatting or holding small tracts and struggling to achieve competency. Something, however, set him apart from his neighbors: Tom Quick had pledged to exterminate every Indian he came across. Before 1763, he did not seem destined to become an Indian slayer. Like many young boys on the frontier, he hunted, fished, and played with young Delawares in the woods around the cabin his father had built, counting them among his closest friends. That is until the end of the French and Indian War, when a young Delaware shot and scalped his father, stripping him of his silver cuff links and shoe buckles. His father&#x2019;s murder transformed Tom Quick. &#x201c;The blood of the whole Indian race,&#x201d; he reputedly declared, &#x201c;is not sufficient to atone for the blood of my father.&#x201d; Tom Quick then promised to kill a hundred Delawares before he died.1&nbsp;Quick killed Indians hunting, sleeping, eating, and drinking. He shot, tomahawked, stabbed, and bludgeoned Indians. He pushed Indians off of cliffs. He slaughtered them when sober and when drunk. He butchered men, women, and children, as well as whole families. As he put it after he had &#x201c;dashed out the brains&#x201d; of an infant, &#x201c;Nits make lice.&#x201d; He preyed on some close to his home, including the Delaware who had scalped his father, and ambushed others far away. During the American Revolution, he roamed frontier regions like the Ohio River valley in search of Indians but not as a patriot. Quick refused to join any militia. He would not support the British, either. Disaffected from any cause, he used the chaos of the period as a license to kill. Quick&#x2019;s reign of terror continued after the United States gained its independence as westerners still struggled with violence. Although proclaimed a monster by officials in these years, in the estimation of common settlers he seemed to stand alone against the indifference of government. In a world of all against all, in which civil society had ceased to exist, only he and his ilk could impose some sort of order. In particular, his unapologetic individualism appeared the only solution to incessant Indian raids. When authorities captured Quick, no jail could hold him because other frontier folks who had lost friends and relatives on the &#x201c;dark and bloody ground&#x201d; that the frontier had become came to his rescue.&nbsp;Quick&#x2019;s spree ended in 1795. As legend had it, he had slaughtered ninety-nine Delawares when he fell ill with&#x2014;ironically&#x2014;smallpox. As he lay dying, he pleaded with his family to drag one last Indian before the foot of his bed within rifle range. By 1795, however, few Indians lived on the Pennsylvania frontier. When Quick made his final request, some sense of order had come to the West as the violence and uncertainty that had gripped the region for decades had ended. So, too, had the presence of Indians in places like the Ohio valley. Quick died one Indian short of his grisly goal.&nbsp;After Quick&#x2019;s death, his legend grew as westerners embellished stories of his vow, his guile, and the many Indians he had killed. The tale began to take even more extraordinary twists. One story that circulated transformed Quick into a deus ex machina, rescuing families under attack from Indians in the nick of time. In one such telling, he arrived breathless to confront and kill a few Indians besieging a house just as the father inside, low on ammunition, was preparing to sacrifice his own children and take his own life rather than see them suffer at the hands of &#x201c;savages.&#x201d; Another tale that made the rounds after he had died went something like this: After Quick was buried, a starving Indian came across the grave, dug up the body, and ate the liver. He then died of smallpox, a fitting end for the hundredth victim. Similar legends had whole villages wiped out by the diseased liver. In tales such as these, Quick achieved in death and a time of peace what he could not in life and a period of war.&nbsp;By the early nineteenth century, easterners were reading romanticized accounts of stories like the Quick myth as books and pamphlets appeared cataloging the exploits of frontiersmen. In these years, the ideas of &#x201c;frontier&#x201d; and &#x201c;revolution&#x201d; enthralled Americans. In many ways, together they epitomized who Americans were, capturing invented notions of collective self carved from memory, shared experience, and circumstance.2 Less than a generation after the Revolution, writers extolled the virtues of the frontier and the critical role of the American Revolution&#x2014;as well as the violence that was their hallmark&#x2014;in creating the democratic and civilized man. Writers like James Eldridge Quinlan, who published a popular tract on the Quick myth, conceived of places like the Ohio valley at the time of revolution as American crucibles, regions where broader national dynamics writ small could be observed.3 The Ohio valley continued to fascinate nineteenth-century Americans much as it had less than a generation before when Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Benjamin Franklin invested in its land, believing like most of their fellow citizens that America&#x2019;s future lay there. With its promise of land and independence, it still attracted the most mobile men and women from the margins of society in the East, as well as speculators and financiers. Now peaceful, it had been contested country. The Ohio valley had once been home to other immigrants, most notably Delawares, Shawnees, and Mingoes, and it witnessed appalling violence before, during, and after the American Revolution. As Americans as a whole understood, the region and its varied peoples featured in the rise and fall of British empire in America before the war and in the fortunes of the American nation after the war. By the early nineteenth century, in other words, the history of what had been one of Tom Quick&#x2019;s hunting grounds for many defined the character of American character.&nbsp;With time, Americans elevated the likes of Tom Quick to sacrosanct status. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Quick tall tale had been rediscovered and had become the subject of popular books and even a play titled Tom Quick, the Avenger; or, One Hundred for One. Its author claimed Quick took his vow to defend the defenseless and out of regard for the memory of a father savagely executed:&nbsp;By the point of the knife in my right,&nbsp;and the deadly bullet in my left;&nbsp;By heaven and all there is in it,&nbsp;by earth and all there is on it;&nbsp;By the love I bore my father,&nbsp;here on his grave I swear eternal vengeance&nbsp;against the whole Indian race.&nbsp;I swear to kill all, to spare none;&nbsp;The old man with the silver hair,&nbsp;The lisping babe without teeth,&nbsp;the mother quick with child, and&nbsp;the maid in the bloom of youth shall die.&nbsp;A voice from my father&#x2019;s grave cries&nbsp;Revenge! Eternal revenge!4&nbsp;According to another account, Quick was &#x201c;the very ideal of strength,&#x201d; tall, powerful, agile, and bright, an individual untethered from society. He was &#x201c;rather a rough-looking representative of the early settlers&#x201d; of the frontier. Standing against the malice of the wealthy, the indifference of government, and savagery, he defined the virtues of the common man. In 1889, Pennsylvanians gathered in his hometown to erect a monument topped with a nine-foot-tall Passaic zinc obelisk dedicated to &#x201c;the memory of Tom Quick, the Indian slayer, the Avenger of the Delaware.&#x201d; The unveiling ceremony, which The New York Times covered the following day under the headline &#x201c;In Honor of Tom Quick,&#x201d; took place amid fanfare after the erection of a liberty pole and speeches by prominent locals.5 The monument, of course, memorialized a myth, not a man. Yet the men and women gathered to celebrate Tom Quick saw in him all that the American Revolution still meant. Quick epitomized the triumph of civilization and democratic values over savagery. Although he had sacrificed innocents, he did so in the service of a broader white civilization. He was its leading edge, society&#x2019;s unrefined precursor and necessary evil.&nbsp;Late-nineteenth-century Pennsylvanians were not alone in finding meaning in men like Quick. The historians and cultural icons George Bancroft and Frederick Jackson Turner, who were writing as frontier legend captured the attention of Americans, also believed that the American Revolution fulfilled a destiny and that the frontier created a distinctive people, uncontaminated by the trappings of hereditary power, relentless class conflict, and vexing ethnic questions that dogged the Old World. If the Revolution signaled the arrival of a distinctively conceived nation, the frontier provided the requisite labor. As Turner explained, on this unforgiving line between savagery and civility, men and women developed those traits most closely associated with Americanness. They did so by taming a place and conquering the savage peoples who inhabited it. Better considered a process than a place, the frontier taught settlers the lessons of democracy. Here, out of necessity, they discovered the virtues of self-reliance and freedom from the dictates of government. Fighting Indians and scrambling to survive, in other words, created the conditions for the...</p><h2>Cities of Ladies: Beguine Communities in the Medieval Low Countries, 12-1565 (The Middle Ages Series)</h2><p><p>Selected by <i>Choice</i> magazine as an Outstanding Academic Title</p><p>In the early thirteenth century, semireligious communities of women began to form in the cities and towns of the Low Countries. These beguines, as the women came to be known, led lives of contemplation and prayer and earned their livings as laborers or teachers.</p><p>In <i>Cities of Ladies</i>, the first history of the beguines to appear in English in fifty years, Walter Simons traces the transformation of informal clusters of single women to large beguinages. These veritable single-sex cities offered lower- and middle-class women an alternative to both marriage and convent life. While the region's expanding urban economies initially valued the communities for their cheap labor supply, severe economic crises by the fourteenth century restricted women's opportunities for work. Church authorities had also grown less tolerant of religious experimentation, hailing as subversive some aspects of beguine mysticism. To Simons, however, such accusations of heresy against the beguines were largely generated from a profound anxiety about their intellectual ambitions and their claims to a chaste life outside the cloister. Under ecclesiastical and economic pressure, beguine communities dwindled in size and influence, surviving only by adopting a posture of restraint and submission to church authorities.</p></p><p>Walter Simons is Associate Professor of History at Dartmouth College.<p>"Comprehensive and authoritative."&#x2014;<i>Medium Aevum</i></p><br><br><p>"This fine work reveals medieval religion as a web of overlapping interests. . . .

She is the author of <i>Tragic Vision and Divine Compassion: A Contemporary Theodicy</i>.This book is very contemporary, quite profound, and yet highly accessible in its phenomenological approach to the problem of evil. Farley refocuses the problem from one of sin to one of suffering and sees the divine response as compassion rather than punishment. Using a wide variety of classical theological and philosophical references together with examples from contemporary history, Farley delineates finitude's inevitable and necessary tragedy and God's redemptive reaching out with the power of love rather than the power of domination.

Written just before her death in 1958, it is Miss Humphrey&#39;s autobiography in art, a gathering together of her experiences in performance and a lucid and practical sourcebook on choreography. One of the truly great figures in the dance world - a pioneer of American modern dance, a great choreographer and teacher whose influences and innovations are apparent everywhere in the field - Miss Humphrey has given us the first modern book on the &#34;art&#34; of choreography, an indispensable guide not only for the modern dance but for all stage creations. The Art of Making Dances presents modern dance as theater. It contains a short history of the dance and various chapters discuss design, dynamics, and rhythm of dance.

Within hours, Ursula is dead . . . by the same illegal poison. Now, as George and Molly Palmer-Jones reconstruct Ursula&#39;s last days, it becomes clear that her sharp eyes and long memory had posed a deadly threat not only to Marcus, but to his chilly wife, his alienated offspring, and others. To bring a killer to justice, Molly and George must uproot a lifetime&#39;s worth of secrets and expose a nest of vicious human vultures.</p><p>Ann Cleeves is the author behind ITV's VERA and BBC One's SHETLAND.

With the British accent the setting demands, John becomes alternately harsh and guttural, then educated and even foppish. He enunciates the women characters with equal aplomb. So one settles back for a manor-house mystery (sort of) as if in an old familiar chair, with a brandy at one's side. The story concerns the poisoning of a busybody and the opportunities practically everybody in the area had to do the old girl in. All of the suspects are associated in some way with the most powerful landholding family in the region. Tallyho!

Ruler of the great Byzantine Empire from 685 to 695, Justinian was deposed by the usurper Leontios, who severed the emperor&#39;s nose in a brutal warning to him never again to return to Constantinople. Defeated, disfigured, and alone, Justinian wandered among barbarian tribes beyond the far borders of the Empire. Finally, after 10 years in exile he gathered together an army of Bulgar mercenaries and returned victorious to Constantinople where with the adornment of the Golden nose, he ruled again until 711. In that year he fell to a mutinous army and was captured and slain. Little has been written about Justinian II since relatively little source material from the period is available.

Micah&#39;s mother told him that something very sad had happened. Their friend Jesus was dead. Bad men had killed him. After hearing the news Micah was sad and scared. Several days later, Micah went into town to check on the nest of eggs again when something wonderful happened. He overheard a man tell a group of women that Jesus was alive and that they should tell others the good news. One of the speckled eggs was cracked. As he looked more closely, Micah saw a tiny beak poking out of the shell. The egg was beginning to hatch! &#34;&#34;Jesus is alive little bird!&#34;&#34; Micah whispered. &#34;You don&#39;t have to hide!

About to turn fifty, Lord Dalrymple decides it is time to find out who would be the heir to the viscountcy. With the help of the family lawyer, who advertises Empire-wide, they have come up with four potential claimants. For his fiftieth birthday, Edgar invites those would-be heirs&#x2015;along with Daisy and the rest of the family&#x2015;to Fairacres, the family estate. </p><p>In the meantime, Daisy is asked to be the family's representative at the lawyer's interviews with the claimants.

She had been busy all day and was only now, after dinner, opening the afternoon post. <br>&#x201c;Postmortem effluvia?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;H-e-i-r.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Coroners?&#x201d; Without looking up from the <i>Evening Standard,</i> Alec reached for his whisky, an indulgence usually reserved for celebrating the end of a big investigation. &#x201c;Undertakers? Worms?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ugh, Daddy, that&#x2019;s disgusting!&#x201d; Belinda&#x2019;s Easter holidays had started just a couple of days earlier, and her father was apt to forget to mind his tongue in her presence. <br>&#x201c;What, worms? Just think, if they didn&#x2019;t do their work we&#x2019;d be up to our necks in bodies.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Alec, really! In any case, &#x2018;heirs&#x2019; is the important word here. Cousin Edgar&#x2019;s coming up to his fiftieth birthday and apparently it dawned on him a few months ago that he hasn&#x2019;t the faintest idea who is heir to the title and Fairacres.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your letter&#x2019;s from Lord Dalrymple?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, Cousin Geraldine. She&#x2019;s frightfully scathing about &#x2018;heirs of the body,&#x2019; but I can&#x2019;t make out why.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;d be because she and Lord Dalrymple have no children. It&#x2019;s just a legal term for legitimate offspring, and their legitimate offspring, ad infinitum.&#x201d; <br>Daisy cast an anxious glance at her stepdaughter. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Mummy,&#x201d; Bel said indulgently. &#x201c;I know what legitimate means, and illegitimate. It&#x2019;s whether the mother and father are married or not.&#x201d; <br>How did children find out such things? Daisy wondered. She was sure she hadn&#x2019;t been aware at the age of thirteen that procreation without matrimony was even possible. Times had changed between 1911 and 1927! <br>&#x201c;I read it in a book.&#x201d; Bel answered her unvoiced question. &#x201c;And looked it up in the dictionary.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, darling, I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re using your dictionary. But I was rather hoping you didn&#x2019;t know what it means.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, Mummy, how positively Victorian!&#x201d; <br>Since Daisy frequently decried the persistent influence of Victorian attitudes in older generations, she was left speechless. <br>Alec had set aside his paper to fill his pipe. Now, between the vigorous puffs required to get it burning, he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really up in all that stuff, but the &#x2018;body&#x2019; bit must mean that step- or adopted children don&#x2019;t count. And the original entail, or patent, or will, or whatever must have specified heirs <i>male</i> of the body. Otherwise, your brother having died, love, I think your sister&#x2019;s eldest son would have inherited the estate and title from your father. Or perhaps Violet first, and then Derek. But don&#x2019;t quote me on that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Derek?&#x201d; said Bel. &#x201c;Oh, wouldn&#x2019;t it be fun if he was Lord Dalrymple!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A new law was passed just last year, though, and I&#x2019;m not sure what effect it has in a situation like this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tommy Pearson must know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s your cousin&#x2019;s solicitor?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. Cousin Edgar always felt Father&#x2019;s lawyer&#x2014;the old family firm since forever&#x2014;condescended to him because he&#x2019;d been a schoolmaster, not brought up to his new station in life. He was very impressed with Tommy&#x2019;s part in that kidnapping business.&#x2026; You didn&#x2019;t hear that, Bel.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;d better go and read in bed,&#x201d; said Belinda with dignity, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;re going to keep talking about things I&#x2019;m not supposed to hear.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Heavens yes, it&#x2019;s after ten. Past your bedtime.&#x201d; <br>Belinda kissed each of them goodnight, then said, &#x201c;Mummy, may I go and see the twins? Just a peek?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course, darling. You don&#x2019;t need to ask. Quiet as a mouse, though.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know. I just like to ask in case Nurse Gilpin catches me. She can&#x2019;t fuss if you&#x2019;ve said yes, can she?&#x201d; <br>Alec grinned. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t count on it. Every victory over Mrs. Gilpin is temporary.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care much if she does fuss. They&#x2019;re my brother and sister, after all. Daddy, is Oliver your &#x2018;heir male of the body&#x2019;?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He would be if I had a title, pet, but you can&#x2019;t inherit a job with the Metropolitan Police. As it is, you&#x2019;re all my heirs.&#x201d; <br>Daisy was not prepared to go into the business of a father&#x2019;s part in the bodily side of parenthood. &#x201c;Run along and tackle Nurse, now, darling,&#x201d; she said firmly. <br>Looking determined, Belinda left the room. <br>Daisy sighed. Sometimes life seemed to be a perpetual battle with Oliver and Miranda&#x2019;s nanny, whose Victorian attitude dictated that parents had no business in the nursery. <br>She returned to consideration of Lady Dalrymple&#x2019;s news. However unrewarding, it was bound to be infinitely preferable to the letter that had lurked beneath it in the pile, from Daisy&#x2019;s mother, the dowager viscountess. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised Pearson didn&#x2019;t find out who the present heir is when he took over.&#x201d; Alec poked disgustedly at the bowl of his pipe with a used matchstick, then reached for the matchbox and started the flare-puff routine again. <br>&#x201c;It may not have crossed his mind. Cousin Edgar probably has a perfectly sound will leaving everything to his wife, and Tommy doesn&#x2019;t go in for aristocratic clients. In fact, I think he does his best to avoid them, because of Madge being Lady Margaret. She told me he&#x2019;s too independent to want to take advantage of her family connections.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I expect all he really wants is to avoid the complications of entailed estates.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t blame him,&#x201d; said Daisy, trying to make out what Cousin Geraldine was going on about. Her writing was the kind that looks very neat but is difficult to decipher. &#x201c;Oh, she&#x2019;s complaining about the Dalrymples not being prolific in the production of sons. What cheek, when she hasn&#x2019;t produced a single heir of the body herself, male or female. Besides, it worked to her advantage. If I&#x2019;d had lots of brothers, she wouldn&#x2019;t be a viscountess.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What exactly is Edgar&#x2019;s relationship to you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never worked it out.&#x201d; Daisy had next to no interest in the ramifications of aristocratic family trees, unlike her friend Lucy. Possibly as a result, Lucy had married the younger son of a marquis and was now Lady Gerald Bincombe, whereas Daisy had married a Scotland Yard detective. &#x201c;Some sort of second cousin, I think. Or third. Once removed, I&#x2019;m pretty sure of that. Geraldine says they&#x2019;re having to go back to my great-great-grandfather&#x2019;s descendents now. That would be my great-grandfather&#x2019;s brothers, I suppose.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Great Scott! They must have been born about&#x2014;let&#x2019;s see&#x2014;1800, or so.&#x201d; Smoke spiralled up and Alec sat back contentedly. <br>&#x201c;The second brother was Edgar&#x2019;s grandfather. Apparently the third never married. The fourth and youngest got a governess into trouble and was shipped off to the West Indies&#x2014;at least, that&#x2019;s the family legend.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not one either your father or your mother would pass on to you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How right you are. Gervaise told me.&#x201d; And Gervaise had gone off to war when she was sixteen, so perhaps she had known about unmarried mothers when she was thirteen. &#x201c;According to the story, the black sheep wrote to his mother when he married, but when he and his bride were not welcomed home with open arms, he was never heard from directly again. A trickle of news came in from travellers. Rumour reported that he had a large family living on the edge of respectability.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Who were not listed in the family bible, I take it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say I ever looked, but I suppose not, or Edgar wouldn&#x2019;t be having so much trouble now. My&#x2014;let&#x2019;s see&#x2014;my grandfather also had a lot of children, a typical Victorian family, so they must have assumed the direct line was well assured. Geraldine says Tommy started the search by hiring someone to go through all the musty old papers in the muniments room. Oh, I think this says&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is there an end to this story, Daisy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you itching to make the acquaintance of all the skeletons in my family&#x2019;s cupboards?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Fraid not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Geraldine does go on a bit. Six pages! Let me see if I can find&#x2026;&#x201d; She skimmed through the rest, picking out phrases here and there. &#x201c;Advertised in newspapers throughout the Empire.&#x2026; Three claimants responded already&#x2014;Good heavens! They&#x2019;ll be at each other&#x2019;s throats&#x2014;Tommy thinks&#x2014;No! She can&#x2019;t be serious. Or am I misreading?&#x2026;&#x201d; She went back to the beginning of the sentence and pored over it word by word. <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;No&#x2019; what?&#x201d; Alec&#x2019;s attention was caught. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it! She wants me to be present when Tommy interviews the would-be heirs. Tommy wanted Edgar, as head of the family, but Geraldine says he&#x2019;d be completely useless.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d agree with her there. Unless one of them turns out to be a fellow lepidopterist, in which case he&#x2019;d be biased in his favour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And Geraldine herself is not a member of the family by birth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about your mother&#x2014;No, the same applies. Though I hardly think she&#x2019;d appreciate anyone reminding her of the fact.&#x201d; <br>Daisy giggled. &#x201c;Darling, can you imagine either of them in attendance? The poor heirs would turn tail and decide the game wasn&#x2019;t worth the candle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your sister? No, I suppose not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I doubt if she&#x2019;s ever spoken to a solicitor in her life. If Tommy really considers it necessary, I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come off it, love. Don&#x2019;t try to tell me you&#x2019;re not dying to listen in.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It might be interesting. And, you never know,&#x201d; she added persuasively, &#x201c;I might spot something proving one of the claimants is a fake.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I presume that&#x2019;s why Pearson would like a family member present. Don&#x2019;t worry, I shan&#x2019;t try to stop you, if he&#x2019;s agreeable. In fact, I&#x2019;d bet he approached Edgar first only as a matter of etiquette and he was really angling for you all along.&#x201d; <br>Such a vote of confidence deserved a kiss, which Daisy duly bestowed. The rest of Geraldine&#x2019;s screed and the dowager&#x2019;s letter did not get read that evening. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Carola Dunn <br></p><h2>The Woman I Was Before: A gripping emotional page turner with a twist</h2><p><p><b>&#x2018;Wow, what a corker of a novel... exactly the sort of novel that creeps into your life and you don&#x2019;t want to put down... will keep you turning the pages, anxiously, excitedly and soon to reach a thrilling conclusion.&#x2019; Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars</b></p><p><b>A new home can be a happy ending.

The rector's forthright secretary, Emma Garret, worries about her employer, as she sees past his Christian cheerfulness into his aching loneliness. Slowly but surely, the empty places in Father Tim's heart do get filled. First with a gangly stray dog, later with a seemingly stray boy, and finally with the realization that he is stumbling into love with his independent and Christian-wise next-door neighbor.

Alma's humble beginnings and scandalous lifestyle would alienate her from the cream of San Francisco society: she became an artists' model, befriended European royalty, married sugar magnate Adolph Spreckels, lived in the grandest mansion in San Francisco, and at age fifty-seven chartered a plane and eloped with a cowboy. But that same larger-than-life personality was a fruitful asset in the many pursuits that claimed her passions, the most notable of which still stands high on the Golden Gate headlands. <i>Big Alma</i> celebrates the woman who brought Rodin's works to America and built the Palace of the Legion of Honor to hold them. <br><br> After six printings, this new edition features new photographs, an updated family tree, and an introduction that explores the intermingling of fact and controversy in the telling of Alma's story.</p><p>Bernice Scharlach (1919-2004), a journalist-historian, wrote for many Bay Area publications.

Their work together in the hit film "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" sowed the seeds for a mutual hatred that would consume their lives. As each fading star tried to outshine the other, lives were upended and reputations were destroyed. Glamorous, merciless, and cruel, their feud became the stuff of legends. Based on interviews the author conducted with both actresses and more than a decade of research, "Bette &amp; Joan" shows the hard-drinking, hard-fighting duo at their best and worst. The epic story of these dueling divas is hilarious, monstrous, tragic, and the inspiration for the Ryan Murphy TV series "Feud" starring Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange.

Adair too was discreetly cultured; yet she took great personal pleasure in the rough and primitive land of her famed JA Ranch in north Texas. Because of physical discomfort and noisy passengers, she detested traveling by railroad coach; yet she could ride all day on horseback and lie down to sleep on a makeshift cot by a waterhole or on an Indian&#x2019;s flea-infested buffalo rug. She was a lady of interesting contradictions.</p><p>This little Diary is her lively account of a two-month trip which she and her husband made into the western part of the United States in 1874. The ostensible purpose of the trip was to hunt buffalo; however, these large beasts actually play a very small part in the journal. Rather, the book is an interesting and often amusing account, by an observant woman, of the long journey from her husband&#x2019;s estate in Ireland to New York, to Chicago and on into upper Michigan, across Lake Superior to Minnesota, down the Mississippi for several days, out to the buffalo-hunting grounds in Nebraska, then to Denver and the wonders of the Rocky Mountains, and finally back to New York and the Europe-bound ship.</p><p>Adair writes with an easy fluency; and her eye for picturesque detail, her taste for amusing incongruities, her romanticist&#x2019;s delight in Nature, and her instinct for a &#x201c;good tale&#x201d; combine to make her Diary pleasant and entertaining reading, while her powers of keen observation provide valuable insight into life as it was then in the West. First printed for private circulation in 1918, the original book is now a rare collector&#x2019;s item of Western Americana. Mrs. Adair said that she was allowing its publication for two reasons. First, she was afraid that her grandchildren and young friends would remember her only as &#x201c;an old lady who sat in an armchair, and whose stick had to be looked for&#x201d;; she wanted them to know that she had once been &#x201c;a very lively person . . . [who] did all sorts of exciting things.&#x201d; Second, she felt it worthwhile to record her experiences because &#x201c;the world is changing so quickly, ways of travelling especially so . . . and I think it may be interesting to compare what was done in 1874 with what will be done by the time the children are able to travel. No doubt they will do their journeys by air, and do many, many things that I have not been able to do; but they can never see the prairies of America in their wild uncivilised state, or hunt buffalo over them, nor can they pow-wow with the Red Indians in a camp on the Platte River. So every time has its own special joys, and the great thing is to miss as little as possible, and to share as much.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Cornelia Adair (1839&#x2013;1921) was a traveller, rancher, and diarist.</p><h2>When I&#39;m on My Knees</h2><p>Drawn from the best-selling When I&#39;m on My Knees, this beautiful gift book celebrates the joy of prayer--through stories, poems, and Scripture.

He stuffed the information away; a question to be asked later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rucksack on the target&#x2019;s right shoulder listed, suggesting weight. The wire coiled into his ear, like River&#x2019;s own, might have been an iPod.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Confirm visual.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River, touching his left ear with his left hand, spoke quietly into what looked like a button on his cuff. &#x2018;Confirmed.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gaggle of tourists crowded the concourse, their distribution of luggage suggesting they were circling the wagons. River skirted them without taking his eyes off the target, who was heading for the annexe platforms; those which waved off trains towards Cambridge, and points east.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trains generally less packed than the northbound HSTs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbidden images arrived: of twisted metal scattered along miles of broken rails. Of trackside bushes lit with flame, and hung with scraps of meat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;What you have to bear in mind&#x2019; &#x2013; the O.B.&#x2019;s words &#x2013; &#x2018;is that worst sometimes does come to worst.&#x2019;<br>The worst had increased exponentially over the last few years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two transport cops by a ticket barrier ignored the target but studied River. Don&#x2019;t approach, he warned silently. Don&#x2019;t come anywhere near me. It was the small details on<br>which enterprises foundered. Last thing he wanted was an audible altercation; anything that startled the target.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cops went back to their conversation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River paused, and mentally regrouped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was of average height, this young man River Cartwright; was fair-haired and pale-skinned, with grey eyes that often seemed inward-looking, a sharpish nose<br>and a small mole on his upper lip. When he concentrated, his brow furrowed in a way that led some to suspect him of puzzlement. Today he wore blue jeans and a dark jacket. But if you&#x2019;d asked him that morning about his appearance, he&#x2019;d have mentioned his hair. Lately, he&#x2019;d favoured a Turkish barber, where they go in close with the&nbsp; scissors, then apply a naked flame to the ears. They give no warning that this is about to happen. River emerged from the chair scoured and scalded like a doorstep. Even now, his scalp tingled in a draught.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without taking his eyes off the target, now forty yards ahead &#x2013; without, specifically, taking his eyes off the rucksack &#x2013; River spoke again into his button. &#x2018;Follow. But give him room.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the worst was a detonation on a train, next worst was one on a platform. Recent history showed that people on their way to work were at their most vulnerable. Not<br>because they were weaker. But because there were a lot of them, packed in enclosed spaces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t look round, trusting that the black-clad achievers were not far behind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To River&#x2019;s left were sandwich outlets and coffee bars; a pub; a pie stall. To his right, a long train lingered. At intervals along the platform travellers negotiated suitcases through its doors, while pigeons noisily changed rafters overhead. A tannoy issued instructions, and the crowd on the concourse behind River swelled, as&nbsp; individuals broke away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always, in railway stations, there was this sense of pent-up movement. A crowd was an explosion waiting to happen. People were fragments. They just didn&#x2019;t know it yet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The target disappeared behind a huddle of travellers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River shifted left, and the target appeared again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He passed one of the coffee bars, and a sitting couple triggered a memory. This time yesterday River had been in Islington. His upgrading assessment involved compiling a dossier on a public figure: River had been allocated a Shadow Cabinet Minister who&#x2019;d promptly had two small strokes, and was in a private ward in Hertfordshire. There seemed no process for nominating a substitute, so River had picked one off his own bat, and had followed Lady Di two days straight without being spotted &#x2013; office/gym/office/wine bar/office/home/coffee bar/office/gym . . . This place&#x2019;s logo sparked that memory. Inside his head, the O.B. barked a reprimand: &#x2018;Mind. Job. Same place, good idea?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good idea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The target bore left.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Potterville,&#x2019; River muttered to himself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He passed under the bridge, and turned left too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A brief glimpse of overhead sky &#x2013; grey and damp as a dishcloth &#x2013; and River was entering the mini-concourse that housed platforms 9, 10 and 11. From its outside wall half a luggage trolley protruded: platform 93/4 was where the Hogwarts Express docked. River passed inside. The target was already heading down Platform 10.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything speeded up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There weren&#x2019;t many people around &#x2013; the next train wasn&#x2019;t due to leave for fifteen minutes. A man on a bench was reading a paper, and that was about it. River picked up his pace, closing the gap. From behind him came a shift in the quality of the noise &#x2013; from all-over babble to focused murmur &#x2013; and he knew the achievers were drawing comment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the target didn&#x2019;t look back. The target kept moving, as if his intention was to climb into the furthest carriage: white tee, blue shirt, rucksack and all. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River spoke into his button again. Said the words &#x2013; Take <i>him</i> &#x2013; and began to run.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Everybody down!&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man on the bench rose to his feet, and was knocked off them by a figure in black.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Down!&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up ahead, two more men dropped from the train&#x2019;s roof into the target&#x2019;s path. Who turned to see River, arm outstretched, waving him to the floor with the flat of his hand. The achievers were shouting commands:<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bag!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop the bag!</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Put the bag on the ground,&#x2019; River said. &#x2018;And get to your knees.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;But I don&#x2019;t &#x2013;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Drop the bag!&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The target dropped the bag. A hand scooped it up. Other hands grabbed at limbs: the target was flattened, spreadeagled, wiped on the tiles, while the rucksack was&nbsp; passed to River. Who set it carefully on the now vacant bench, and unzipped it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overhead, an automated message unspooled around the rafters. <i>Would Inspector Samms please report to the operations room.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Books, an A4 notepad, a pencil tin.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would Inspector Samms</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Tupperware box holding a cheese sandwich and an apple.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> please report to</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River looked up. His lip twitched. He said, quite calmly &#x2013;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the operations roo</i>m<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Search him.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t hurt me!&#x2019; The boy&#x2019;s voice was muffled: he had a faceful of floor, and guns pointing at his head. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target, River reminded himself. Not <i>boy</i>. Target. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Would Inspector Samms</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;<i>Search</i> him!&#x2019; He turned back to the rucksack. The pencil tin held three biros and a paperclip.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please report to</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;He&#x2019;s clean.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River dropped the tin to the bench and upended the sack. Books, notepad, a stray pencil, a pocket-sized pack of tissues.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the operations room</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They scattered on the floor. He shook the rucksack. Nothing in its pockets.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Check him again.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;He&#x2019;s clean.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Would Inspector Samms</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Will somebody turn that bloody thing off?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catching his own note of panic, he clamped his mouth shut.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;He&#x2019;s clean. Sir.&#x2019;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please report to</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River again shook the rucksack like a rat, then let it drop. <i>the operations room</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the achievers began speaking, quietly but urgently, into a collar-mic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River became aware of someone staring at him through the window of the waiting train. Ignoring her, he began to trot down the platform.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Sir?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a certain sarcasm to that.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would Inspector Samms please report to the operations room.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue shirt, white tee, River thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White shirt, blue tee?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He picked up speed. A transport policeman stepped forward as he reached the ticket bay but River looped round him, shouted an incoherent instruction, then ran full pelt back to the main concourse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Would Inspector Samms</i> &#x2013; and the recorded announcement, a coded message to staff that a security alert was taking place, switched off. A human voice took its place:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Due to a security incident, this station is being evacuated. Please make your way to the nearest exit.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had three minutes tops before the Dogs arrived.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River&#x2019;s feet had a direction of their own, propelling him towards the concourse while he still had room to move. But all around, people were getting off trains, onboard announcements having brought sudden halts to journeys that hadn&#x2019;t yet begun, and panic was only a heartbeat away &#x2013; mass panic was never deep beneath the surface, not<br>in railways stations and airports. The phlegmatic cool of the British crowd was oft-remarked, and frequently absent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Static burst in his ear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tannoy said: &#x2018;Please make your way calmly to the nearest exit. This station is now closed.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;River?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shouted into his button. &#x2018;Spider? You idiot, you<br>called the wrong colours!&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;What the hell&#x2019;s happening? There are crowds coming<br>out of every &#x2013;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;White tee under a blue shirt. That&#x2019;s what you said.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No, I said blue tee under &#x2013;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Fuck you, Spider.&#x2019; River yanked his earpiece out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d reached the stairs, where the crowd sucks into the underground. Now, it was streaming out. Irritation was its main emotion, but it carried other whispers: fear, suppressed panic. Most of us hold that some things only happen to other people. Many of us hold that one such thing is death. The tannoy&#x2019;s words chipped away at this belief.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The station is now closed. Please make your way to the nearest exit.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tube was the city&#x2019;s heartbeat, thought River. Not an east-bound platform. The tube.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed into the evacuating crowd, ignoring its hostility. <i>Let me through</i>. This had minimal impact. Security. <i>Let me through</i>. That was better. No path opened, but people stopped pushing him back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two minutes before the Dogs. Less.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corridor widened at the foot of the stairs. River raced round the corner, where a broader space waited &#x2013; ticket machines against walls; ticket windows with blinds drawn down; their recent queues absorbed into the mass of people heading elsewhere.&nbsp; Already, the crowd had thinned. Escalators had been halted; tape strung across to keep fools off. The platforms below were emptying of passengers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River was stopped by a transport cop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Station&#x2019;s being cleared. Can&#x2019;t you hear the bloody tannoy?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I&#x2019;m with intelligence.

As their stories show, by focusing on the most positive and productive elements of any situation, you can shape your inner experience and expand your world. By learning to focus, you can improve your concentration, broaden your inner horizons, and most important, feel what it means to be fully alive.</p><p><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Winifred Gallagher on <i>Rapt</i></strong> <br> <p> A wise research psychiatrist once told me that he had identified life's greatest problem: How to balance self and others, or your need for independence with your need for relationship? Since writing <i>Rapt</i>, I've come to believe that we now face a fundamental psychological challenge of a different sort: How to balance your need to know&#x2014;for the first time in history, fed by a bottomless spring of electronic information, from e-mail to Wikipedia--with your need to be? To think your thoughts, enjoy your companions, and do your work (to say nothing of staring into a fire or gazing dreamily at the sky) without interruption from beeps, vibrations, and flashing lights? Or perhaps worse, from the nagging sense that when you're off the grid, you're somehow missing out? <br><br> Science's new understanding of attention can help shape your answers to this question, which pops up all day long in various forms. When you sit at your computer, will you focus on writing that report or aimless web browsing? At the meeting, will you attend to the speaker or to your BlackBerry? Research suggests that your choices are more consequential than you may suspect. When you zero in on a sight or sound, thought or feeling, your brain spotlights and depicts that "target," which then becomes part of the subjective mental construct that you nonetheless confidently call "reality" or "the world." In contrast, things that you ignore don't, at least with anything like the same clarity. As William James succinctly puts it, "My experience is what I agree to attend to." <br><br> The realization that your life&#x2014;indeed, yourself--largely consists of the physical objects and mental subjects that you've focused on, from e-bay bargains to world peace, becomes even more sobering when you consider that, as the expression "pay attention" suggests, like your money, your concentration is a finite resource. How can you get the highest experiential return for this cognitive capital? By focusing on some screen or on playing your guitar? On IM-ing your old friend or joining her for a walk? <br><br> Considering the Internet's countless temptations and distractions, deciding how best to invest your time and attention when you're online is particularly challenging. Left to its own devices, your involuntary, "bottom-up" attention system asks, "What's the most obvious, compelling thing to zero in on here? That e-mail prompt? This colorful ad?" Fortunately, evolution has also equipped you with a voluntary, "top-down" attention system that poses a different question: "What do you want to focus on right now? Ordering that new novel, then checking the weather report, then getting back to work, right?" Sometimes, it's fun to just wander around online, allowing your mind to be captured by random, bottom-up distractions. In general, however, it's far more productive to focus on top-down targets you've selected to create the kind of experience you want to invite. <br><br> Along with making clear choices about what things merit your precious attention online, there are some other simple ways to protect the quality of your daily life from technological interference. Remember that your electronics are your servants, not your masters, and don't let them choose your focus for you. Abandon vain attempts to "multitask," because when you try to attend to two things at once&#x2014;phoning while checking e-mail&#x2014;you're simply switching rapidly between them, which takes longer and generates more errors. When you need to concentrate on an important activity, try to work for 90 minutes without interruptions, because rebooting your brain can take up to 20 minutes. <br><br> Most important, as you go about the day, bear in mind that by taking charge of your attention, you improve your experience, increase your concentration, and lift your spirits. Best of all, enjoying the rapt state of being completely absorbed, whether by a website or a sunset, a project or a person, simply makes life worth living. We cannot always be happy, but we can almost always be focused, which is as close as we can get. <br><br></p>Winifred Gallagher&#x2019;s books include <i>House Thinking, Just the Way You Are</i> (a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book), <i>Working on God</i>, and <i>The Power of Place</i>.

She was a pupil at Bedales school between 1918 and 1924, studied journalism at London University and published her first crime novel, Give a Corpse a Bad Name, in 1940, the year that she met her second husband, academic Robert Brown. Highly praised by critics, her brand of intelligent, gripping mysteries beloved by readers, she wrote over seventy novels and was also published (as E. X. Ferrars) in the States, where she was equally popular. Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine described her as as &#39;the writer who may be the closest of all to Christie in style, plotting and general milieu&#39;, and the Washington Post called her &#39;a consummate professional in clever plotting, characterization and atmosphere&#39;. She was a founding member of the Crime Writer&#39;s Association, who, in the early 1980s, gave her a lifetime achievement award.One of Britain's most dependable and prolific mystery writers dishes up a feast of suspects and red herrings in the latest of more than 60 published novels. Marred only minimally by the hesitancy with which the amateur detective, con man and chronic liar Felix Freer, confronts the plot's complications, the story begins with the death of elderly, well-off Helen Lovelock in the town of Allingford. Survivors are a grandnephew arrived from Australia only a few months earlier, and a grandniece who flies in from America. When the niece is shot in bed soon after the funeral, the deceased's woefully unprovided-for housekeeper calls for help to Virginia Freer, Felix's estranged wife, who is living next door. As the neighbors assemble--they include a disturbed man and his self-sacrificing mother, a teacher and his wife--a safe full of emeralds (which may be fakes) is hastily ransacked. Virginia summons Felix and the chase is on. Ferrars ( Sleep of the Unjust ) establishes multiple layers of deception, drawing on all to fashion her deft solution. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Passionate Spirituality: Hildegard of Bingen and Hadewijch of Brabant</h2><p>In a format that is accessible, inspirational, and informed by serious scholarship, Passionate Spirituality explores the roots and meanings of passion in western culture, and examines how passion is expressed in the works of two medieval women mystics--&#34;Hildegard of Bingen and Hadewijch of Brabant. From that perspective, the author goes on to examine the role of passion in the lives of contemporary Christians seeking to deepen their own spiritual journeys. Elizabeth Dreyer points out that, far too often, the term &#34;passion&#34; is associated either with romance and sexuality or with political fanaticism--&#34;thus cutting off the breadth of its meaning for spiritual expression. But the great mystics succed precisely because they hold together the affectie and the intellectual aspects of the spiritual life in creative and convincing ways. Their accounts of their mystical experience are important resources for information and understanding about how to talk about God more formally, and for what it means to be passionately in love with God and the world. Passionate Spirituality looks not only to the past, but to the present and future as well as Dreyer explores whether and how these mystical texts might infuse contemporary spirituality with new life, and theological thinking with greater insight. She shows how the expression of mystical experience brings fresh perspectives that allow the affections to influence our thinking and our spiritual life and has the potential to open the deep structures of one&#39;s personality to the fullness of grace, to contribute to the ongoing creation of a new self as image of God, and to lead to the pursuit of compassion and commitment to justice on behalf of asuffering world. Passionate Spirituality fills an important niche between scholarly works on medieval women, and books of excerpts or simple meditations. It sholuld also appeal to a wide range of lay and clerical ministers and as a study book for adult education classes and discussion groups. It will also serve as a useful text for classes on medieval religious experience, women&#39;s history; feminist theology; and Christian mysticism.</p><p>Elizabeth A. Dreyer, PhD, professor of religious studies at Fairfield University, is a well-known lay theologian, author and lecturer. She is the author of Earth Crammed with Heaven: A Spirituality of Everyday Life and the editor of The Cross in Christian Tradition: From Paul to Bonaventure, both published by Paulist Press.Ever since Aristotle, Western culture has divorced emotion from reason and body from soul. Thanks to Paul and Augustine, the Christian tradition has associated passion with unbridled and lustful sex and often vilified women as creatures of passion who use the wiles of their bodies to seduce men away from reason. Thus, Christian writers have viewed with suspicion any traces of passion in the religious life. In her spirited, but sometimes pedantic, study, Dreyer, a Fairfield University religious studies professor, ardently restores passion to its central role in the spiritual life. Beginning with the Greeks, she traces the history of the idea of passion in the West, focusing especially on its presence in biblical texts from the Psalms to Song of Songs and the ways in which early Christian writers such as Origen viewed it positively. Dreyer then explores the depths of desire with which two medieval women mystics, Hildegard of Bingen and Hadewijch of Brabant, passionately sought God. The writings of these women reveal not only an intense longing for union with Christ, often expressed in erotic and affectionate language, but also a recognition that their quest is both intellectual and emotional. While Dreyer offers little new about Hildegard or Hadewijch, she uses their lives and work to fervently revive passion in the spiritual life. <i>(Mar. 30) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(<i>Kirkus Review</i>)</p><h2>The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll: The Search for Dare Wright</h2><p><b>A glamorous, haunted life unfolds in the mesmerizing biography of the woman behind a classic children's book</b><br><br> In 1957, a children's book called <i>The Lonely Doll</i> was published. With its pink-and-white-checked cover and photographs featuring a wide-eyed doll, it captured the imaginations of young girls and made the author, Dare Wright, a household name. <br><br>Close to forty years after its publication, the book was out of print but not forgotten. When the cover image inexplicably came to journalist Jean Nathan one afternoon, she went in search of the book-and ultimately its author. Nathan found Dare Wright living out her last days in a decrepit public hospital in Queens, New York. <br><br>Over the next five years, Nathan pieced together a glamorous life. Blond, beautiful Wright had begun her career as an actress and model and then turned to fashion photography before stumbling upon her role as bestselling author. But there was a dark side to the story: a brother lost in childhood, ill-fated marriage plans, a complicated, controlling mother. Edith Stevenson Wright, herself a successful portrait painter, played such a dominant role in her daughter's life that Dare was never able to find her way into the adult world. Only through her work could she speak for herself: in her books she created the happy family she'd always yearned for, while her self-portraits betrayed an unresolved tension between sexuality and innocence, a desire to belong and painful isolation. <br><br>Illustrated with stunning photographs, <i>The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll </i>tells the unforgettable story of a woman who, imprisoned by her childhood, sought to set herself free through art. <br></p><p><b>Jean Nathan</b> was educated at Williams College and the Columbia School of Journalism. She was a staff writer for <i>The New York Observer</i> and a senior editor at <i>Connoisseur</i> magazine. She has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, <i>ARTNews</i>, and other publications. She lives in New York City.<br>From <i>The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll</i>:<br>Mostly, when Edie had to be out in the world, Dare was left at home alone. There, she learned to find comfort and companionship in her books and her dolls, and to fire up her imagination. If Dare's first dolls were improvisational, homemade, the books Edie bought Dare when she was feeling flush were the real thing. The first two she purchased were a collection of Grimm's fairy tales and a picture book called <i>The Lovely Garden</i>, the story of the much-beloved Princess Yolande who lives on the Island of Can-be-done, whose "sweet smile seemed to say: 'What am I here for if it is not to make others happier?'" The book's message was reminiscent of her mother's inscriptions on the backs of her portraits-"To my Good and Precious Daughter"-directives on how to act and so meet the conditions of Edie's love. But the mechanics of fairy tales carried a message, too. If princesses could be put to sleep and awaken unharmed, perhaps fathers and brothers could also. If princesses could escape punishing circumstances, perhaps Dare could, too.<br></p><h2>Writing And Grammar 9</h2><p>Review the eight parts of speech, five basic sentence patterns, usage, and mechanics.

The transparency and luminosity of the paint, its quick drying time and the fact that it is easily portable - these are just a few of the factors that contribute to its popularity. Once they&#39;ve mastered basic watercolour techniques, however, many watercolourists begin to look for new creative challenges Watercolour Plus...shows how you can combine watercolour with other mediums without abandoning the very qualities that attracted you to watercolour in the first place. Each chapter is written by a different artist and looks at either one aspect of watercolour painting or at watercolour used in conjunction with one other medium. Each chapter begins with a short step-by-step introduction to the techniques required, complete with practical exercises and project ideas for readers to try on their own. This is followed by a series of &#39;gallery pages&#39;, analysing works by a number of contemporary artists, which provides an invaluable source of ideas that amateurs can incorporate into their own work and gives an insight into how professional artists approach the business of painting. The result is a thoroughly practical and inspiring introduction to painting in mixed media - one of the most rapidly growing areas of interest to amateur artists.</p><p>Ray Balkwill gave up a career in graphic design to concentrate on painting.

The thesis of this book is that Israel and the church are distinct theological institutions that have arisen in the historical progress of divine revelation. But they are also related as successive phases of a redemptive program that is historically progressive and eschatologically converging. The approach to these issues here is neither polemical nor apologetic; rather, it anticipates a convergence among evangelical scholars in the recognition of both continuity and discontinuity in the Israel-church relationship. This book has three purposes: - To offer a contemporary dispensational treatment of that relationship through an exegetical examination of key texts with a focus on theological concerns - To foster genuine dialogue with nondispensational thinkers regarding major biblical themes tied to the plan of God - To identify the changes in dispensational thought that have developed since the publication of Charles Ryrie's book Dispensationalism Today in 1965</p></p><p>Craig Blaising is Executive Vice President &amp; Provost and Professor of Theology at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.

By looking at the precedents, circumstances, and artistry of the first perfect poems composed by John Milton, John Keats, T. S. Eliot, and Sylvia Plath, <i>Coming of Age as a Poet</i> offers rare insight into this mysterious process, and into the indispensable period of learning and experimentation that precedes such poetic achievement. </p><p> Milton's <i>L'Allegro</i>, Keats's <i>On First Looking into Chapman's Homer</i>, Eliot's <i>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</i>, and Plath's <i>The Colossus</i> are the poems that Helen Vendler considers, exploring each as an accession to poetic confidence, mastery, and maturity. In meticulous and sympathetic readings of the poems, and with reference to earlier youthful compositions, she delineates the context and the terms of each poet's self-discovery--and illuminates the private, intense, and ultimately heroic effort and endurance that precede the creation of any memorable poem. </p><p> With characteristic precision, authority, and grace, Vendler helps us to appreciate anew the conception and the practice of poetry, and to observe at first hand the living organism that breathes through the words of a great poem. </p></p><p>Helen Vendler is A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University.<i>In Coming of Age as a Poet</i>, Vendler...chooses one breakthrough poem by each of four poets--Milton, Keats, Eliot, and Plath. Through close readings of their structure, imagery, and scansion, she shows how these poems mark each poet's mastery of a unique voice...The clarity and expert analysis of all four poems could engage even a casual reader, while the breadth of scholarship and unique interpretations will appeal to more experienced poetry readers. Vendler's work is highly recommended.<br> --Vivian Reed (<i>Library Journal</i> 2003-01-01)<br><br>Where does a poet's voice come from and of what is it forged?

Powers (<i>Boston Sunday Globe</i> 2003-03-23)<br><br>Reading a Vendler essay is like coming home to the cave; like entering the mind of the poet. In <i>Coming of Age as a Poet</i>, a collection of four essays, Vendler looks at the point in the lives of four poets...when they came into their own maturity as poets, found their discourses, the styles and the voices that would make them immortal...Vendler shows them on their vulnerable ascents to greatness.<br> --Susan Salter Reynolds (<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> 2003-03-30)<br><br>A clear but subtle account of the struggles, the rites of passage, undergone by four poets, while still in their 20s, negotiating with tradition in order to find their style and attain their majority--to become, in fact, major poets...Each chapter becomes a short story, a thrillingly compressed account of the vicissitudes of genius...It is a pleasure to be guided by [Vendler] into the poet's workshop--she is so good at making poetry matter, at opening up the interest of passages one had dully taken for granted.<br> --Philip Horne (<i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>Though modest in size, <i>Coming of Age</i> contains numerous original insights into the creative process, especially into that formative period in which a poet finds his or her technique, style, and voice.<br> --D.

Alfred Prufrock'...[This book is] full of perceptions and rewards that send one scurrying back to the text.<br> --John Bayley (<i>New York Review of Books</i> 2003-11-20)<br><br>[Vendler's] attention to the psychological and aesthetic unraveling of the poet's calling turns the microscopic into the majestic.<br> --Jacques Khalip (<i>Boston Review</i> 2003-10-01)<br><br>Using Milton, Keats, Eliot and Path as her case studies, Ms. Vendler 'consider[s] the work a young poet has to have done before writing his or her first "perfect poem"--the poem which first wholly succeeds in embodying a coherent personal style.' This is a bold claim and a challenging book, but Ms. Vendler succeeds brilliantly in keeping us hooked. By the end we are better readers.<br> --Tom Mayo (<i>Dallas Morning News</i> 2003-12-21)<br><br>[Vendler] has offered up a brief but profound inspiration to any reader willing to take the time to move slowly, with curiosity and attention, through her investigation of four cases of great poetry.<br> --Len Edgerly (<i>Bloomsbury Review</i> 2004-01-01)<br><br>As to books about poetry, you could hardly do better than <i>Coming of Age as a Poet</i> by superb U.S. critic Helen Vendler, in which she illuminates the first perfect poems by John Milton, John Keats, T.

Bhaskar develops a critical realist philosophy, which isolates the definition of being in terms of knowledge as the characteristic flaw of traditional philosophy. He conceives a &#x201c;transformational&#x201d; model of society and sees social science as explanatory, and therefore of assistance to political projects of emancipation. Concerned to bridge the gap between philosophy and politics, <i>Dialectic</i> argues that critical realism provides the basis of a completely new and general methodology for the human sciences. This book also contains an account of the history of Western philosophy, from its pre-Socratic origins to its contemporary post-modernist forms.</p><p><b>Roy Bhaskar</b> is an independent scholar and founder of the critical realist movement in the social sciences. He is the author of several books, including <i>The Possibility of Naturalism</i>, <i>Reclaiming Reality</i>, <i>Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom</i> and <i>Philosophy and the Idea of Freedom</i>.&#x201c;[I] deeply admire its vast range, rigour and originality. It will be a massively important work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Professor Terry Eagleton, University of Oxford<br><br>&#x201c;Bhaskar goes back to the beginning of the western philosophical quest and offers a brilliant refashioning of the dialectic. Because his &#x2018;dialectical critical realism&#x2019; is systematic, ontologically sustained and self-consciously ethical and political, he is able to give stunning readings of key chapters in the history of philosophy. This is a unique book full of gems&#x201d;&#x2014;Professor Peter Manicas, University of Hawaii<br><br>&#x201c;In this stunning book, Roy Bhaskar develops his own programme of critical realism into a radically new and original theory of dialectics and a critique of previous theories from the ancient Greeks to twentieth-century neo-Marxism. The result is comparable in its scope and ambition to Sartre&#x2019;s <i>Critique of Dialectical Reason</i>. It is hard to think of any other contemporary philosopher with the powers to bring this off ... In short, this is a work of the very highest importance which will be one of the major reference points of philosophical and social thinking in the nineties and beyond.&#x201d;&#x2014;Professor William Outhwaite, University of Sussex</p><h2>Much Ado About Nothing (Arden Edition of the Works of William Shakespeare)</h2><p>Set in a courtly world of masked revels and dances, this play turns on the archetypal story if a lady falsely accused of unfaithfulness, spurned by her bridegroom, and finally vindicated and reunited with him. Villainy, schemes, and deceit threatens to darken the brilliant humor and sparkling wordplay--but the hilarious counterplot of a warring couple, Beatrice and Benedick, steals the scene as the two are finally tricked into admitting their love for each other in Shakespeare&#39;s superb comedy of manners.</p><p>A revised edition of the Arden Third Series play, edited by leading scholar Claire McEachern.The general editors of the new series of forty-two volumes -- renowned Shakespeareans Stephen Orgel of Stanford University and A.

She lives in Chicago.I didn&#x2019;t recognize him at first. He came into my office unannounced, a jowly man whose hairline had receded to a fringe of dark curls. Too much sun had baked his skin the color of brick, although maybe it had been too much beer, judging by those ill-named love handles poking over the sides of his jeans. The seams in the faded corduroy jacket strained when he moved his arms; he must not often dress for business.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, girl, you doing okay for yourself up here, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> I stared at him, astonished and annoyed by the familiarity.<br><br> &#x201c;Tori Warshawski, don&#x2019;t you know me? I guess Red U turned you into a snob after all.&#x201d;<br> Tori. The only people who called me that had been my father and my cousin Boom-Boom, both of them dead a lot of years now. And Boom-Boom&#x2019;s boyhood friends&#x2014;who were also the only people who still thought the University of Chicago was a leftist hideout.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not Frank Guzzo, is it?&#x201d; I finally said. When I&#x2019;d known him thirty years and forty pounds ago, he&#x2019;d had a full head of red-gold hair, but I could still see something of him around the eyes and mouth.<br> &#x201c;All of him.&#x201d; He patted his abdomen. &#x201c;You look good, Tori, I&#x2019;ll give you that. You didn&#x2019;t turn into some yoga nut or a vegan or something?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Nope. I play a little basketball, but mostly I run the lakefront. You still playing baseball?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;With this body? Slow-pitch sometimes with the geriatric league. But my boy, Frankie Junior, Tori, I got my fingers crossed, but I think he&#x2019;s the real deal.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How old is he?&#x201d; I asked, more out of politeness than interest: Frank always thought someone or something was going to be the real deal that made his fortune for him.<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s fifteen now, made varsity at Saint Eloy&#x2019;s, even though he&#x2019;s only a freshman. He&#x2019;s got a real arm. Maybe he&#x2019;ll be another Boom-Boom.&#x201d;<br> Meaning, he could be the next person to make it out of the &#x2019;hood into some version of the American dream. There were so few of us who escaped South Chicago&#x2019;s gravitational pull that the neighborhood could recite our names.<br> I&#x2019;d managed, by dint of my mother&#x2019;s wishes, and my scholarships to the University of Chicago. My cousin Boom-Boom had done it through sports. He&#x2019;d had seven brilliant seasons with the Blackhawks until he injured his ankle too badly for the surgeons to glue him back in any shape to skate. And then he&#x2019;d been murdered, shoved off a pier in the Port of Chicago, right under the screw of the Bertha Krupnik.<br> When Boom-Boom and Frank hung out together, Frank hoped he&#x2019;d be a real deal, too, in baseball. We all did&#x2014;he was the best shortstop in the city&#x2019;s Catholic league. By the time I started law school, though, Frank was driving a truck for Bagby Haulage. I don&#x2019;t know what happened; I&#x2019;d lost touch with him by then.<br><br> Maybe he could have been a contender. He wasn&#x2019;t the only kid in South Chicago with a spark of promise that flared up and died. They start to spread their wings and then they fall to earth. It&#x2019;s hard to leave the world you know. Even if it&#x2019;s a painful place at times, you grow up learning how to navigate it. The world north of Madison Street looks good on TV, but it has too many hidden traps, places where a homey can make a humiliating mistake.<br> Perhaps Frankie Junior would have the drive, the mentors and the talent to be another Boom-Boom. All I said was I hoped Frank was right, it would be great. &#x201c;You stayed in South Chicago?&#x201d; I added.<br> &#x201c;We moved to the East Side. My wife&#x2014;uh, Bet&#x2014;uh,&#x201d; he stumbled over the words, his face turning a richer shade of brick.<br> Frank had left me for Betty Pokorny when we were all in high school. Her father had owned Day &amp; Night Bar &amp; Grill. When the mills were running three shifts, no matter what time you got off or went on, you could get steak and eggs with a boilermaker.<br> When Betty started smirking at me in the high school hallway, I&#x2019;d been heartbroken for a few weeks, but my dad told me that Frank wasn&#x2019;t right for me, that I was looking for love in all the wrong places because Gabriella had died a few months earlier. He&#x2019;d been right: it had been years since I&#x2019;d thought about either Frank or Betty.<br> Looking at Frank this morning, in his ill-fitting jacket and uneasy fidgeting, he seemed vulnerable and needy. Let him imagine that hearing about Betty could cause me a pang or two.<br> &#x201c;How are Betty&#x2019;s folks?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &#x201c;Her ma passed a few years back, but her dad is still going strong, even without the bar&#x2014;you know they had to shut that down?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Someone told me,&#x201d; I said. Day &amp; Night had followed the mills into extinction, but by then I was so far removed from the neighborhood that I hadn&#x2019;t even felt Schadenfreude, only a vague pity for Frank.<br> &#x201c;Her dad, he keeps busy, he&#x2019;s handy with tools, builds stuff, keeps the house from falling over. I guess you don&#x2019;t know we moved in with him when, well, you know.&#x201d;<br> When they got married, I guessed. Or maybe when Stella went to prison. &#x201c;What did you do about your place on Buffalo?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ma kept it. My dad&#x2019;s insurance or something let her make the payments while she was in Logan. I looked in on it once a week, made sure nothing was leaking or burning, kept the rats and the gangbangers from moving in. Ma says she owns it clear and free now.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s out?&#x201d; I blurted.<br> &#x201c;Yeah. Two months ago.&#x201d; His heavy shoulders sagged, further stressing the shoulders in the jacket.<br> Annie Guzzo had been three years younger than me and I was finishing my junior year of college when she died. I counted in my head. I guess it had been twenty-five years.<br> South Chicago was a neighborhood where violence was routine, ordinary. Stella Guzzo had grown up in a hardscrabble house herself and shouting and hitting were her main modes of functioning. We all knew she hit her daughter, but what turned people&#x2019;s stomachs was that Stella had beaten Annie to death and then walked up to St. Eloy&#x2019;s to play bingo. Not even my aunt Marie, Stella&#x2019;s chief crony, stood up for her.<br> &#x201c;I never made those marks on my girl,&#x201d; Stella protested at the trial. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re lying about me, making me look bad because I was trying to get Annie to see the facts of life. She was getting those big ideas, way above herself. She didn&#x2019;t think she needed to vacuum or do the laundry because she was going to school, but she needed to remember she was part of a family. Everyone has to carry their weight in a family. She&#x2019;s got a brother, he&#x2019;s the one with a future and he needs looking after, I can&#x2019;t do it all on my own, especially not with their father dead. But Annie was fine when I left the house.&#x201d;<br> Father Gielczowski, the priest at St. Eloy&#x2019;s, had testified for Stella: she was a good woman, a dedicated mother. She didn&#x2019;t spare the rod, but that was what made her a good mother; she didn&#x2019;t tolerate the rudeness a lot of modern women let their children get away with.<br> Priests usually play well with Chicago juries, but not this time. Stella was built on massive lines, not fat, but big, like the figurehead of a Viking ship. Frank took after her, but Annie was small, like their father. The state&#x2019;s attorney showed pictures of Annie&#x2019;s battered face, and the family photos where she looked like a dark little elf next to her mother&#x2019;s broad-shouldered five-ten.<br> Instead of manslaughter, the state went for second-degree homicide, and got it. I didn&#x2019;t remember the trial clearly, but I don&#x2019;t think the jury deliberated longer than half a day. Stella drew the full two dimes, with a little extra thrown in to punish her for her belligerent attitude in court.<br> I never would be a Stella fan, but the thought of her alone in a decrepit South Chicago bungalow was disturbing. &#x201c;Is she there by herself?&#x201d; I asked Frank. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard dealing with the outside world when you&#x2019;ve been away from it so long. Besides that, South Chicago is a war zone these days, between the Kings, and the Insane Latin Dragons and about five other big gangs.&#x201d;<br> He fiddled with a chrome paperweight on my desk. &#x201c;I told Ma it wasn&#x2019;t safe, but where else was she going to go? Betty didn&#x2019;t want her living with us. It didn&#x2019;t seem right, turning my own mother away after all she&#x2019;s been through, but, you know, she&#x2019;s not the easiest person to have around. Ma said she knew when she wasn&#x2019;t wanted. Besides, she insisted on returning to the old place. It&#x2019;s hers, she says, it&#x2019;s what she knows.<br> &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t care that the neighborhood&#x2019;s shot to heck. Or she cares but all her old pals, they&#x2019;ve moved further south, or they&#x2019;re in assisted living. Either way, she doesn&#x2019;t want to be near them. Thinks they&#x2019;ll always be talking about her behind her back.&#x201d;<br> Frank dropped the paperweight. It bounced onto the floor where it dented one of the boards. We watched it roll under my worktable.<br> &#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t why you came up here today, is it, Frank?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not imagining I&#x2019;ll baby-sit Stella, I hope.&#x201d;<br> He picked up a stapler and started opening it and snapping it shut. Staples began falling onto the desktop and floor. I took it from him and set it down, out of his reach.<br> &#x201c;What is it, Frank?&#x201d;<br> He walked to the door, not trying to leave, just trying to pull words together. He walked around in a circle and came back.<br> &#x201c;Tori, don&#x2019;t get mad, but Ma thinks&#x2014;Ma says&#x2014;she thinks&#x2014;she says&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> I waited while he fumbled for words.<br> &#x201c;Ma is sure she was framed.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, that doesn&#x2019;t surprise me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You know she was?&#x201d; His face lightened.<br> &#x201c;No, Frank. But I believe she wants to rewrite the story of her life. She always set herself up as the most moral, pious woman in South Chicago, then she does time, can&#x2019;t face the women she used to look down on. Of course she has to change the past so she&#x2019;s the martyr, not the villain.&#x201d;<br> He pounded his thighs in frustration. &#x201c;She could have been framed, it could have happened. I never believed she would have hit Annie hard enough to hurt her.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I am not going to spend time and energy trying to prove your mother&#x2019;s innocence.&#x201d; My mouth set in a tight line.<br> &#x201c;Did I ask you to do that? Did I? That isn&#x2019;t what I want.&#x201d; He sucked in a deep breath. &#x201c;She can&#x2019;t afford a lawyer, a real lawyer, I mean, not a public defender, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And you thought of me?&#x201d; I was so angry I jumped to my feet. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what the gossip about me is in South Chicago, but I did not become Bill Gates when I moved away. And even if I did, why would I help your mother? She always thought Gabriella was some kind of whore, that she cast a spell over your dad and then stole Annie. Stella liked to say I was a bad apple falling close to a rotten tree, or words to that effect.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2014;I know she said all that stuff. I&#x2019;m not asking you to be her lawyer. But you could ask questions, you&#x2019;re a detective, and people know you, they&#x2019;d trust you the way they wouldn&#x2019;t trust a cop.&#x201d;<br> By now his face was so scarlet that I feared he&#x2019;d have a stroke on the spot.<br> &#x201c;Even if I wanted to do this, which I don&#x2019;t, I don&#x2019;t know the neighborhood anymore. I&#x2019;ve been away as long as Stella has. Longer.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You were just back there,&#x201d; he objected. &#x201c;I heard about it at Sliga&#x2019;s, that you&#x2019;d been to the high school and everything.&#x201d;<br> I shouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised. South Chicago and the East Side are like a small town. You sneeze on Ninetieth Street, they whip out a handkerchief on Escanaba Avenue.<br> Over the weekend, I&#x2019;d taken Bernadine Fouchard, Boom-Boom&#x2019;s goddaughter, on a tour of my cousin&#x2019;s old haunts. I showed her the place near Dead Stick Pond where he practiced skating in the winter, and where I&#x2019;d help him hunt for the puck when it went into the nearby marsh grasses. We&#x2019;d gone to the breakwater in Calumet Harbor where Boom-Boom and I used to dare the freighters by jumping in to swim. I&#x2019;d taken her to the public high school where I played on the state champion basketball team, picked up tacos at Estella&#x2019;s on Commercial Avenue. We hadn&#x2019;t gone to Sliga&#x2019;s bar, but probably someone at the high school mentioned it over a boilermaker.<br> &#x201c;I went as a tourist, Frank. I can&#x2019;t help your mother.&#x201d;<br> He came over to me, gripping my arms. &#x201c;Tori, please. She went to, well, to a lawyer, who told her there wasn&#x2019;t any evidence.&#x201d;<br> I pulled away. &#x201c;Of course there isn&#x2019;t. If she&#x2019;d had any evidence when Annie died, she could have used it at her trial.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Tori, come on, you know what it&#x2019;s like, you go to court, it&#x2019;s all confusing, she never pled guilty but the lawyer, he was inexperienced, he didn&#x2019;t know how to run the case.&#x201d;<br> Frank was right: a trial is bewildering for inexperienced defendants. I didn&#x2019;t like Stella, but I could imagine how unbalanced she must have felt. She&#x2019;d never been to court, not even to fight a traffic ticket. She wouldn&#x2019;t have known the first thing about how evidence is presented, how everything you say on the stand, or before you ever get to trial, is taken apart and put together again in a way you&#x2019;d never recognize.<br> &#x201c;Even so, I am not wasting time and energy on problems Stella brought on herself.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you let go of that old grudge? Ma&#x2019;s had a hard life. Dad died in the mill, she had to fight the company for his workers&#x2019; comp, then Annie died&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Frank, listen to yourself. She murdered Annie. And she had to fight the company for the comp claim because she started spreading rumors that your father committed suicide. Don&#x2019;t you remember what Stella did at Gabriella&#x2019;s funeral? She marched in on the middle of the service and dragged Annie out, yelling that Gabriella was a whore. I do not feel sorry for your mother. I will never feel sorry for your mother.&#x201d;<br> Frank grabbed my hands. &#x201c;Tori, that&#x2019;s why I thought&#x2014;hoped&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you remember, that was the night&#x2014;Annie was that upset, I never saw her like that, when Ma dragged her home&#x2014;if someone told me Ma or Annie, one would kill the other, I would have thought Annie for sure, after your ma&#x2019;s funeral. But I&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you remember?&#x201d;<br> My mother&#x2019;s funeral was a blur in my mind. My father and I, uncomfortable in our dress-up clothes. The pallbearers&#x2014;my uncle Bernie; Bobby Mallory, my dad&#x2019;s closest friend on the force; other cops, all in their dress uniforms; a police chaplain, since my unreligious mother hadn&#x2019;t known a rabbi. Gabriella had been a wisp by the time she died; her coffin couldn&#x2019;t have taken six big men to lift it.<br> Mr. Fortieri, my mother&#x2019;s vocal coach, fought back tears, twisting a silk handkerchief over and over, but Eileen Mallory wept openly. I could feel the tightness again in my throat&#x2014;I had vowed I wouldn&#x2019;t cry, not in front of my aunt Marie. Annie Guzzo&#x2019;s sobs had angered me. What right had she to cry for Gabriella?<br> And then Stella roared in, beside herself. Mouth flecked white with spit, or was that a detail I was adding? At home that night I&#x2019;d sat alone in the dark in my attic room, staring at the street, unable to move, leaving my dad to deal with his drunk sister Elena and the stream of neighbors, of cops, of my mother&#x2019;s piano and voice students. And then&#x2014;<br> Frank had appeared at the top of the steep flight of stairs, come to say how sorry he was, for my loss, for his mother&#x2019;s behavior. In the dark, sick with loss, tired of the adult world on the ground floor, I&#x2019;d found a comfort in his embrace. Our teenage fumblings with clothes and bodies, neither of us knowing what we were doing, somehow that got me through the first hard weeks of Gabriella&#x2019;s death.<br> I squeezed Frank&#x2019;s fingers and gently removed my hands. &#x201c;I remember. You were very kind.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So will you do this, Tori? Will yo...</p><h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Shinji Ikari Raising Project, Vol. 9</h2><p>Face the thing that should not be!

Fights over taxes. Racial resentments. A Lakers-Celtics championship. <i>The Karate Kid</i> topping the box-office charts. Bon Jovi touring the country. These words could describe our current moment&#x2014;or the vaunted iconography of three decades past.<br> <br>In this wide-ranging and wickedly entertaining book, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling journalist David Sirota takes readers on a rollicking DeLorean ride back in time to reveal how so many of our present-day conflicts are rooted in the larger-than-life pop culture of the 1980s&#x2014;from the &#x201c;Greed is good&#x201d; ethos of Gordon Gekko (and Bernie Madoff) to the &#x201c;Make my day&#x201d; foreign policy of Ronald Reagan (and George W. Bush) to the &#x201c;transcendence&#x201d; of Cliff Huxtable (and Barack Obama).<br> <br>Today&#x2019;s mindless militarism and hypernarcissism, Sirota argues, first became the norm when an &#x2019;80s generation weaned on Rambo one-liners and &#x201c;Just Do It&#x201d; exhortations embraced a new religion&#x2014;with comic books, cartoons, sneaker commercials, videogames, and even children&#x2019;s toys serving as the key instruments of cultural indoctrination. Meanwhile, in productions such as <i>Back to the Future, Family Ties,</i> and <i>The Big Chill</i>, a campaign was launched to reimagine the 1950s as America&#x2019;s lost golden age and vilify the 1960s as the source of all our troubles. That 1980s revisionism, Sirota shows, still rages today, with Barack Obama cast as the 60s hippie being assailed by Alex P. Keaton&#x2013;esque Republicans who long for a return to Eisenhower-era conservatism. <br> <br>&#x201c;The past is never dead,&#x201d; William Faulkner wrote. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even past.&#x201d; The 1980s&#x2014;even more so. With the native dexterity only a child of the Atari Age could possess, David Sirota twists and turns this multicolored Rubik&#x2019;s Cube of a decade, exposing it as a warning for our own troubled present&#x2014;and possible future.</p><p><b>An Essay from Author David Sirota</b> <br> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <b>Five &#x2019;80s Flicks That Explain How the &#x2019;80s Still Define Our World</b><br> <i>Back To Our Future</i> posits that the 1980s--and specifically 1980s pop culture--frames the way we think about major issues today. The decade is the lens through which we see our world. To understand what that means, here are five classic flicks that show how the 1980s still shapes our thinking on government, the &#x201c;rogue,&#x201d; militarism, race, and even our not-so-distant past. <p></p> 1. <i>Ghostbusters</i> (1984): Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, Egon Spengler, and Winston Zeddmore seem like happy-go-lucky guys, but these are cold, hard military contractors. Between evading the Environmental Protection Agency, charging exorbitant rates for apparition captures, and summoning a Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the merry band shows a Zoul-haunted New York that their for-profit services are far more reliable than those of the Big Apple&#x2019;s wholly inept government. At the same time, the Ghostbusters were providing 1980s audiences with a cinematic version of what would later become the very real Blackwater--and what would be the anti-government, privatize-everything narrative of the twenty-first century. <p></p> 2. <i>Die Hard</i> (1988): Though the 1980s was setting the stage for the rise of anti-government politics today, it was also creating the Palin-esque &#x201c;rogue&#x201d; to conveniently explain the good things government undeniably accomplishes. Hitting the silver screen just a few years after Ollie North&#x2019;s rogue triumphalism, John McClane became the &#x2019;80s most famous of this &#x201c;rogue&#x201d; archetype--a government employee who becomes a hero specifically by defying his police superiors and rescuing hostages from the twin threat of terrorism <i>and</i> his boss&#x2019;s bureaucratic clumsiness. This message is so clear in <i>Die Hard</i>, that in one memorable scene, McClane is yelling at one police lieutenant that the government has become &#x201c;part of the problem.&#x201d; <i>Die Hard</i>, like almost every national politician today, says government can only work if it gets out of the way of the rogues, mavericks, and rule-breakers within its own midst. <p></p> 3. <i>Rambo: First Blood Part II</i> (1985): &#x201c;Sir, do we get to win this time?&#x201d; So begins the second--and most culturally important--installment of the Rambo series. The question was a direct rip-off of Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s insistence that when it came to the loss in Vietnam, America had been too &#x201c;afraid to let them win&#x201d;--them, of course, being the troops. The theory embedded in this refrain is simple: If only meddling politicians and a weak-kneed public had deferred to the Pentagon, then we would have won the conflict in Southeast Asia. Repeated ad nauseum since the 1980s, the &#x201c;let them win&#x201d; idea now defines our modern discussion of war. If only we let the Pentagon&#x2019;s Rambos do whatever they want with no question or oversight whatsoever, then we can decisively conclude the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan...and we can win the neverending &#x201c;War on Terror.&#x201d; <p></p> 4. <i>Rocky III</i> (1982): Before the 2008 presidential campaign devolved into cartoonish media portrayals of the palatable &#x201c;post-racial&#x201d; Barack Obama and his allegedly unpalatable &#x201c;overly racial&#x201d; pastor Jeremiah Wright, there was <i>Rocky III</i> more explicitly outlining this binary and bigoted portrayal of African Americans. Here was Rocky Balboa as the determined but slightly ignorant stand-in for White Middle America. Surveying the diverse landscape, the Italian Stallion could see only two kinds of black people&#x2014;on one side the suave, smooth, post-racial Apollo Creed, and on the other side the enraged, animalistic Clubber Lang. Rocky thus gravitated to the former, and reflexively feared the latter, essentially summarizing twenty-first-century White America&#x2019;s often over-simplistic and bigoted attitudes toward the black community today. <p></p> 5. <i>The Big Chill</i> (1983): This college reunion flick from Lawrence Kasdan is hilarious, morose, and seemingly nostalgic for the halcyon days of the past; but powerfully propagandistic in its negative framing of the 1960s. Over the course of the film&#x2019;s weekend, character after character berates the 1960s as an overly decadent age that may have been rooted in idealism, but was fundamentally destined to fail. Sound familiar? Of course it does. The 1980s-created narrative of the Bad Sixties can still be found in everything from national Tea Party protests to never-ending culture-war battles on local school boards. The message is always the same: If only America can emulate the Big Chillers and get past its Sixties immaturity and liberalism, everything will be A-okay. <p></p><b>David Sirota </b>is a journalist, nationally syndicated weekly newspaper columnist, and radio host.

To say nothing of what happens when they arrive: eating grasshoppers in Mexico, forgetting the tide schedule while collecting sand dollars off the coast of Georgia, and mistaking alligators for logs in the middle of Okefenokee Swamp. Husband-and-wife team David Homel and Marie-Louise Gay have combined their writing and illustrating talents with their own family memories to produce a very different kind of travelogue. <i>Travels with My Family</i> is told from the point of view of a long-suffering big brother who must fulfill many roles in this eccentric family keep little brother out of trouble; humor artist Mom while she seeks out beauty and inspiration in the least likely places; and discourage nearsighted, tone-deaf Dad from pulling out the road map to search for yet another strange destination.</p><p>Gr. 3-5. For a boy and his younger brother, family vacations are tough because rather than visits to amusement parks or sunny beaches, the family encounters alligators in the Okefenokee swamp, eats grasshoppers, and dodges New Year's gunfire in Mexico. What's more, if things can go wrong, they will. Even so, there are unexpected rewards, such as seeing beautiful rock formations in caves. The family's episodic adventures, relayed by the older brother in a droll, first-person narrative, are often comical and sometimes suspenseful as they offer glimpses of natural wonders, extreme weather, and exotic locales. The family members are never named, and some ironic comments and events will resonate more with adults than with young readers. But the family dynamics still ring true, and kids will relate to being dragged along with little say, and even come to appreciate the family's unusual vacation experiences. Gay, author-illustrator of such delightful picture books such as <i>Stella, Star of the Sea</i> (1998), provides several black-and-white illustrations. <i>Shelle Rosenfeld</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Grade 3-6&#x2013;In short, amusing chapters, a boy describes his family's trips to off-the-beaten-path locations in North America and Mexico. Though he and his little brother would prefer to go to Disneyland, their parents insist on avoiding tourist areas and taking the road less traveled&#x2013;usually with unexpected, sometimes hair-raising results. For example, the family remains steadfast in their Maine beach cottage during Hurricane Bob, is stalked by alligators in the Okefenokee Swamp, is pummeled by tumbleweeds in an Arizona sandstorm, and encounters revolutionaries during a drive through Mexico. Although there is very little character or plot development, these brief adventures are sprinkled with humor, moments of discovery, and an appreciation for the beauty and diversity of less-lauded destinations. Written with simple language and adorned with amusing cartoon sketches, this title is a good choice for those new to chapter books or for struggling readers.<i>&#x2013;Corinda J.

The class was for lawyers, accountants, record and film company executives, managers, agents, and bartenders who want to manage groups. Anyway, at the beginning of one of these courses a friend of mine came up to me. She was an executive at a film studio and was taking the class to understand the music industry as it relates to films. She said, "I'm here to open up the top of my head and have you pour in the music business." I loved that mental picture (because there are many subjects I have wanted to absorb this same way), and it spurred me to develop a painless way of infusing you with the extensive materials in this book. So if you'll sit back, relax, and open up your mind, I'll pour in all you need to know about the music business (and a bit more for good measure).</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>HOW I GOT STARTED</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>I really love what I do. I've been practicing music law for over twentyfive years, and I represent recording artists, record companies, film companies, songwriters, producers, music publishers, film music composers, industry executives, managers, agents, business managers, and other assorted mutants that populate the biz.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I got into this on purpose, because I've always loved creative arts. My first show-biz experience was in grade school, performing magic tricks for assemblies. I also started playing accordion in grade school. (I used to play a mean accordion; everyone applauded when I shook the bellows on "Lady of Spain." I gave it up because it's impossible to put the moves on a girl with an accordion on your chest.) By high school, I had graduated from accordion to guitar, and in college at the University of Texas, I played lead guitar in a band called Oedipus and the Mothers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While I was with Oedipus, we recorded a demo that I tried to sell to our family friend, Snuff Garrett (more about him later). Snuff, a powerful record producer, very kindly took the time to listen to the demo and meet with me. That meeting was a major turning point in my life. Snuff listened to the record, smiled, and said, "Don...go to law school."</p><p></p><p></p><p>So I took Snuff's advice, and went to Harvard Law School. In law school I continued to play lead guitar with a band called The Rhythm Method, but it was becoming apparent that my ability to be in the music business and eat regularly lay along the business path. So when I graduated, I began doing tax planning for entertainers. Tax law, like intricate puzzles, was a lot of fun, but when I discovered there was such a thing as music law, the electricity really turned on. In fact, I took the USC class that I later taught, and it got me so excited that I left the tax practice for my current firm. Doing music law was so much fun that it wasn't even like working (I'm still not over that feeling); and I enjoyed it so much that I felt guilty getting paid (I got over that).</p><p></p><p></p><p>My first entertainment law experience was representing a gorgeous, six-foot model, referred to me by my dentist. (I promised him I would return the favor, because most of my clients had teeth.) The model was being pursued (I suspect in every way) by a manager who wanted a contract for 50% of her gross earnings for ten years. (You'll see how absurd this is when you get to Chapter 3.) Even then I knew this wasn't right, and so I nervously called up the guy to negotiate. I still remember my voice cracking as I said his proposal was over the industry standards, since most managers took only 15% (which was true). He retorted with, "Oh yeah? Who?" Well, he had me. I wasn't even sure what managers did, much less who they were. So I learned my first lesson in the art of humility.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As I began to really understand how the music business worked, I found that my love of both creative arts and business allowed me to move smoothly between the two worlds and help them relate to each other. The marriage of art and commerce has always fascinated me -- they can't exist without each other, yet creative freedom and the need to control costs are eternally locked in a Vulcan death match. Which means the music business will always need lawyers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Anyway, I now channel my creative energies into innovative business deals, and my need to perform is satisfied by teaching, lecturing, and playing guitar at my kids' campouts. (I do a great "Kum-Ba-Ya.") Just to be sure I don't get too straight, however, I've kept up my weird assortment of hobbies: magic, ham radio, weight-lifting, guitar, dog training, five-string banjo, karate, chess, and real estate investment. I also write novels, which you are all required to buy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>BRAIN SURGERY</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>Speaking of marrying creativity and business, I've discovered that a rock star and a brain surgeon have something in common. It's not that either one would be particularly good at the other's craft (and I'm not sure which crossover would produce the more disastrous results), but rather that each one is capable of performing his craft brilliantly, and generating huge sums of money, without the need for any financial skills. In most businesses, before you can start earning big bucks, you have to be pretty well schooled in how the business works. For example, if you open up a shoe store, you have to work up a budget, negotiate a lease, bargain for the price of the shoes, and so forth -- all before you smell that first foot. But in entertainment, as in surgery, you can soar to the heights without any expertise in the business end of your profession.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Making a living from a business you don't fully understand can be risky. Yet a large number of artists, including major ones, have never learned such basics as how record royalties are computed, what a copyright is, how music publishing works, and a number of other concepts that directly affect their lives. They don't know these things because (a) their time was better spent making music; (b) they weren't interested; (c) it sounded too complicated; and/or (d) it was too much like being in school to have to learn it. But without understanding these basics as a foundation, it's impossible for them to understand the intricacies of their professional lives. And as their success grows, and their lives get more complex, they become even more lost.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While it's true that some artists refuse to even listen to business talk (I've watched them go into sensory shutdown if you so much as mention the topic), others get interested and really study their business lives. The vast majority, however, are somewhere in the middle of these extremes. They don't really enjoy business, but want to participate intelligently in their career decisions. These artists are smart enough to know that no one ever takes as good care of your business as you do.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was for my moderate-to-seriously interested clients that I developed a procedure of explaining the basics in simple, everyday language. With only a small investment of time, these clients got down the essential concepts, and everyone enjoyed the process (including me). It also made an enormous difference in the artist's self-confidence about his or her business life, and allowed them to make valuable contributions to the process.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Because the results of these brief learning sessions were so positive, several clients asked if we could explore the subjects more deeply. Thus the conception of this book. It's designed to give you a general overview of the music industry as it currently exists. You can read it as casually or intensely as suits your interest level, attention span, and pain tolerance. It's not written for lawyers or technicians, so it doesn't include the jargon or minutia you'll find in a textbook for professionals. Instead, it gives a broad overview of each segment of the industry, and goes into enough detail for you to understand the major issues you're likely to confront.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>JUNGLE MAPS</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>When I was in high school, a policeman named Officer Sparks spoke at an assembly. Mr. Sparks hyped us on the life of a crime fighter, certain that we all secretly wanted to be cops. While the man didn't sway me off the path of my destiny, he did show me something I'll never forget.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Officer Sparks ran a film in which the camera moved down a street. It was a grainy black-and-white movie, only about thirty seconds long, and consisted of a camera bobbing along a sidewalk. When it was finished, he asked if we'd seen anything unusual. No one had. Apart from a couple of people bouncing in and out of the doorways, it looked pretty much like pictures taken by a camera moving along a row of shops. Mr. Sparks then said that a "trained observer" who watched the film could spot six crimes being committed. He showed the film again and pointed out each of the incidents (there was a quiet exchange of drugs, a pickpocket, etc.). This time, the crimes were obvious.

In the nineteenth century they were in shipping from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and on the great rivers of Europe--the Rhine, the Danube, even the Russian River Dnieper. I myself was born beside a river--the Avon in Sarum. So when I first encountered New York's great harbor and the Hudson River as a teenager, and came to understand their historic canal and railroad links to the vast spaces of the Midwest, I felt both the thrill of a new adventure, and a deep sense of homecoming. </p> <p>I first considered writing <i>New York</i> in 1991. I'd been in the city for a decade, was married to an American wife and sending my children to New York schools. I was even on the board of a coop building. But I wasn't sure how to organize such complex material, and for many years I put the project aside.</p> <p>It was kind encouragement and old-fashioned editing from William Thomas at Doubleday that finally persuaded me to try again. And soon I was hooked.</p> <p>New York's gift to the storyteller is magnificent: Indian and Dutch beginnings; larger-than-life historical characters like Lord Cornbury, the transvestite British Governor, the socialite Mrs. Astor, and the titanic J.P. Morgan; huge events from the Revolutionary War and the Civil War--when New York threatened to secede from the Union--to the Crash of '29 and the tragedy of 9/11. But it's the ordinary people I discover in my research--African slaves, Irish laborers, society ladies and sweatshop workers--whose lives move me most, and who provide so many of my plots and characters. </p> <p>My own personal experiences also helped. I descend from both Philadelphia Quakers and Carolina colonists whose families were separated by the Revolutionary War. That helped give me insight into the agony of Patriots who, until the British government denied their claims, had always, like Ben Franklin himself, thought of themselves as free-born Englishmen. One of my closest friends since university is an Italian immigrant. Understanding the poverty and humiliations of her childhood helped me create the book's Caruso family who came through Ellis Island and lived in Little Italy.</p> <p>I also love discovering how things work. It was as fascinating to study the history of Wall Street banking--and how financial crises always repeat themselves!--as it was to learn how the Empire State Building was constructed.</p> <p>But above all, what I love about New York is that people have always come there in search of freedom, and usually found it. I was lucky to be born beside Sarum's Avon. But I'd like my New York children to scatter my ashes in the Hudson. <i>--Edward Rutherfurd</i></p> <p>(Photo � Jeanne Maseoro)</p>Edward Rutherfurd has lived in London, New York, New Hampshire, and Ireland.

In <i>The Unbroken Chain</i>, this unsung hero tells his story, and he's got the right stuff. Wendt, who immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1949, got a job as a mechanical engineer for McDonnell Aircraft that launched his space career. He eventually became the man who supervised preparations for every mission from the Mercury program through the early shuttle flights. He was the last person the astronauts would see before they closed the hatch, and he became something of a legend at NASA. <i>The Unbroken Chain</i> features Wendt's accounts of his career highlights, good and bad, as well as behind-the scenes revelations about missions and personalities. Three sections of great photos accompany the text, and best of all, the accompanying CD-ROM features a tour of Cape Canaveral hosted by Wendt himself. A must-have for space buffs, and a great accompaniment to the NASA Mission Reports series, also from Apogee Books. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Guenter </b>is a former mechanical engineer for McDonnell Aircraft and the individual responsible for the spacecraft test, checkout, and launch operations for all the Mercury and Gemini manned flights conducted at Cape Canaveral.

Plenty, according to The Big Unplugged. This book helps youth find common ground in Alcoholics Anonymous-a book which may sometimes seem remote to today&#39;s teens. The author summarizes each chapter of the Big Book, and in fresh, frank language, addresses issues faced and roadblocks erected by teens�invincibility, surrender, spirituality, and more.</p><p><p>John R. sobered up at seventeen-before he was even old enough to legally drink. With more than twenty years of continuous sobriety, he has worked as chemical dependency counselor with young people in high schools and residential treatment centers. He also has written extensively on the subject of adolescent addiction and recovery.</p><p><strong>Chapter 2<br>THERE IS A SOLUTION</strong></p> <p><br>Alcoholism is the only disease that tries to <br>convince you that you don't have it.</p> <p>So what's the purpose of the Big Book? It's simple: The Big Book provides solutions to what we couldn't fix. It tells us how to recover from the seemingly hopeless condition of addiction. Our own efforts at fixing things didn't work. Yet, this chapter promises that we're capable of taking steps that will work.<br>Even though the Big Book was written decades ago, its advice still holds true today. It has stood the test of time. The solutions offered in the Big Book work for people of all ages and all walks of life. They formed the foundation of the AA Fellowship.</p> <p><strong>Radical Thinking</strong></p> <p>The authors call alcoholism an illness in chapter 2. That was radical thinking sixty years ago when the book was written. Back then, society viewed an alcoholic as a moral failure. Alcoholism was treated with ignorance and misunderstanding. Thankfully, much has changed. Today, many people know alcoholism or drug addiction is a disease. Like other diseases, alcoholism can be passed down in families. Likewise, alcoholics and addicts need medical treatment.</p> <p>The solution to recovery remains the same now as years ago. Even with the advance in society's attitudes, no one understands the addict better than another addict. Perhaps that's because our illness is unlike other illnesses. It tends to hurt and anger those around us rather than stir up sympathy and compassion. We need that special understanding offered by other addicts, or our fellows. Those who have found "the solution" can usually "get through" to using alcoholics or addicts because they understand in a way few others can. That's the bond upon which our Twelve Step Fellowship is based and by which the message spreads.</p> <p>Chapter 2 tells us that at some point addicts can no longer stop drinking or drugging once they've taken that first drink or hit. They've lost control. The drugs now control them.</p> <p>Willpower won't work. Our resolve isn't strong enough. Staying clean can't happen through some trick of the mind. The addiction is too powerful, and we lose the power of choice.</p> <blockquote> <p>The disease seems to invade every fiber of our being, infecting us even when we're straight. Despite a string of negative consequences and every good reason to quit, we persist:</p></blockquote> <ul> <li>We drink to get drunk; we use to get high. </li><li>Our personality changes when intoxicated. </li><li>We have a "positive genius" for getting wasted at just the wrong moment. </li><li>We become dishonest and selfish. </li><li>We protect our supply. </li></ul> <p>Yet, most of us were not ready to give up alcohol and drugs. We tried to find some trick to drink or use without the consequences. We've got a name for that too: denial.</p> <p>Why do addicts act like this? Why, when they know from experience the problems that using causes, do they use again?</p> <p>That's the wrong question. We can't answer it. Truth be told, most of us have no idea why we kept using.</p> <p>The better question is, "What do I have to do to recover from this seemingly hopeless condition?" That's where the solution comes in.</p> <p><strong>Simple, but Not Easy</strong></p> <p>By now, you're no doubt asking, what the heck is this "solution" they keep talking about?</p> <p>It's simple. The solution is to change. Through a spiritual experience, we overhaul our way of looking at and being in the world. We surrender our plans and submit to God's will. We turn from self-centeredness and begin a life of service to others.</p> <p>It's simple, but not easy. At first, most didn't like the requirements&#x2014;self-searching, leveling of pride, confession of shortcomings. Since our way hadn't worked, we were willing to try it, especially when we saw how it had worked for others.</p> <p>Basically, it came down to two choices:</p> <ul> <li>follow our addiction to its bitter end, which meant insanity, incarceration, or death, or </li><li>accept spiritual help. </li></ul> <p>There was no middle road or shortcut. It was drink until we dropped, or surrender. Stay with the problem, or embrace the solution.</p> <p>The solution, we found, was nothing short of a miracle, especially considering our doubts. Surrendering to God brings relief. God can do for us what we could never do by ourselves.</p> <p>Not only has God liberated us from our addiction, God has given us the grace to change our attitude and approach to life. Cutting out the drugs is just the beginning. The solution lies in applying the principles we've discovered to every aspect of our lives. (More on these principles and working the Steps in later chapters.) The solution is more than a means to quit using, it's a "design on living."</p> <p>This design is drawn from the paradox that we cannot keep what we have unless we give it away. In helping others, we help ourselves. Service, particularly helping the addict who is still suffering, becomes the foundation of sobriety. In fact, our very lives depend on helping others. That gives our lives purpose. And it keeps us sober.</p> <p>Instead of looking out for ourselves, we try to be useful to others. We talk to other addicts about what we know. We share our own painful experience with others who need to know they aren't alone. That can give our lives purpose. And it keeps us sober.</p> <p><strong>More God Stuff</strong></p> <p>So what's with the spiritual experience? Chapter 2 defines a spiritual experience as a new way of looking at life. We throw away old ideas and attitudes that hurt us and others.</p> <p>Appendix 2, in the back of the Big Book, further describes what the authors mean by a "spiritual experience." Some people had sudden, dramatic spiritual experiences. But most people had slow, subtle transformations. Sometimes they happened so slowly that others spotted the changes before the individual was even aware of them. Eventually the individual realized that he or she no longer carried the old outlook.</p> <p>These positive changes didn't occur solely through the individuals' efforts. God did for them what they couldn't do for themselves. Slowly, surely, they were transformed into happy people. Tapping into this resource&#x2014;this Power greater than themselves&#x2014;is the essence of spiritual experience.</p> <p>The authors of the Big Book say that religion alone won't supply this vital spiritual experience. They also stress that there are many ways to tap into the spiritual source. Just as there are many paths up the same mountain, there are many ways to discover a Higher Power. The key is to be open and willing.</p> <p>In fact, willingness, honesty, and open-mindedness are the keys to recovery. Willingness, honesty, and open-mindedness unlock a whole new life.</p> <p>The Big Book also offers hope. We can experience a new life if we do these things:</p> <ul> <li>face our problems honestly </li><li>keep our minds open to spiritual concepts </li><li>beware of attitudes of intolerance and denial </li></ul> <p>Remember, sometimes the answers to our problems don't come in the form we expect. And sometimes we may be looking for ways to keep using. So be honest about your motives. And be willing to accept the help of other recovering people.<br></p> &nbsp; <p>�2003. All rights reserved.

Always send with delivery confirmation.</p><p>Stamets captures one of the country's longest-operating farmers' markets in 72 photographs. Taken with the aid of a 127 lens, these panoramic pictures are free of the "fish-eye" effect of a traditional wide-angle lens, and the black-and-white format imparts a sense of timelessness and unity to the images of vendors and patrons at the market. Color would be superfluous, particularly in the photograph of a Greek shopkeeper applying finishing touches to a Venus de Milo crafted of gyro meat. Dunnington's anecdotal text provides the right commentary to pictures that range from candid glimpses of shoppers and street people to proud vendors posing with their wares. This book is sure to pique interest in Seattle's homely treasure. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sarah&#39;s Quilt: A Novel of Sarah Agnes Prine And The Arizona Territories, 1906</h2><p><br><i>Sarah's Quilt</i>, the long-awaited sequel to <i>These Is My Words</i>, continues the dramatic story of Sarah Agnes Prine.

All I heard for a time was the rhythm of my boots scuffing gravel. My horse was standing where I&#x2019;d left him, his reins held by my niece Mary Pearl, who&#x2019;d been out checking stock with me since dawn. I knew not to ride a horse into that commotion. I thought I heard her hollering &#x201c;Aunt Sarah?&#x201d; but I didn&#x2019;t quit running toward the sound that had stopped us. As I tore through brush, an ironwood tree clutched at my clothes; thorns ripped my skirt. The troubled bellow of a cow was accompanied by a pitiful, higher-pitched bawling. Along with that, a pack of coyotes yipped.I cleared the rise. The mother cow whirled around at that second, hooked a coyote on one horn, and threw it high over her back. They were half-hidden by a thicket of greasewood and cholla&#x2014;in a clear place just wide enough for the pack of killers to trap the mother and baby. The calf had blood running down its legs and it whimpered. The mother cow dashed and whirled, fending off another and another coyote, as others circled behind her and nipped at her baby.I tried to yell, but I had no wind left. My throat was parched as old rope. I slung the rifle to my shoulder and picked off two coyotes. The crippled one had made it back into the path of the cow. As she tried to fight the coyote, it bit into her ankle, and she dragged it, its body clinging to her foot like a rag, before she got it loose. Fierce as she was, the coyotes knew their game was to outlast her, and while the mother cow thrashed, three more closed in on the calf. I ran again, this time finding my voice, shouting the whole way. Mary Pearl told me later that what I was hollering would not be fit talk for her mother&#x2019;s parlor, but I don&#x2019;t remember it.I pulled up the rifle again, chambering a shell as I did. With a shot, I dropped another coyote in his tracks, and he squirmed when he fell, but he didn&#x2019;t get up. The little calf dropped to its knees and then lay on its side. I could see then that the mother cow was torn in the milk bag. Streaky red liquid oozed from her wound. She stomped and shook that animal off her ankle as I shot another. When one coyote remained, he turned tail and lit out into the brush, gone like a drop of water in this hot desert. Well, I started to move toward the calf; then the panicked cow decided to come after me. She put her head low and scuffed at the dust. I took up part of my skirt and flapped it at her, waving my hat in the other hand, and she backed up, mooing, looking for danger from all around. The poor old girl was bleeding from the nose, too. I whistled and Mary Pearl came riding in my direction, leading my horse. Two baldhead buzzards looped in the sky overhead.The calf made a human-sounding wail. I knelt at its side. Poor baby was not two months into this hard world. I picked his little head up and laid it in my lap, coddling him as if he were a child. He&#x2019;d been bitten all around the gut and his sack was torn clear off. By the time the cow started back my way, I saw the calf&#x2019;s eyes sink and knew he was dead. The cow bandied her head and groaned. Mary Pearl tossed a rope around her neck and tied it off to the horse&#x2019;s saddle, then backed the horse, pulling that mother cow around. The coyotes had been at her worse than I&#x2019;d been able to see before. I&#x2019;d figured I could doctor up the milk bag&#x2014;I&#x2019;d done as much before. Not this one, though&#x2014;flesh hung from her leg and long blue veins dangled from her neck on the left side. Mary Pearl went to my horse, and from the saddle, she slung another rope over the cow&#x2019;s horns. She picketed the two horses so the cow was held between them.The cow thrashed, limping on her mangled hoof and ankle, and shook the second lariat from its loose hold on her horns. Mary Pearl backed her horse more to keep the line taut while the animal jerked against it. In midstride, the cow collapsed, breathing hard through a spew of blood and sand and slobber. Mary Pearl rode closer, easing the tension on the rope. She said, &#x201c;Aunt Sarah? Has she given in?&#x201d;I wiped my face with my sleeve and hung my head. Shock and fear had done what the coyotes couldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ve known cattle to outlast amazing things. Some don&#x2019;t. Maybe their hearts burst. Lord knows I&#x2019;ve felt that way, watching my own child die. The old girl pitched in the dirt and bellowed, but she didn&#x2019;t get up. I said, &#x201c;Ride on back to the house. Take my horse. I want to walk. I&#x2019;ll bring your rope by and by.&#x201d;I reckon Mary Pearl knew better than to fuss with me right then, for she did as I said without her usual commotion. I walked around the cow, talking to her, my voice soft and low. &#x201c;You fought &#x2019;em off, didn&#x2019;t you, old girl? Don&#x2019;t you go giving up now. You&#x2019;ll have another baby round the bend.&#x201d; Suddenly struggling to her feet, the cow made another threatening stance, lunged toward me, but then fell into the dirt, banging her great head against a rock outcrop. She moaned: a pitiful, suffering noise. It is a hard step for me&#x2014;always somewhat of a surprise&#x2014;to stop hoping and accept that there is no hope for an animal but a slow, agonizing death. My foreman shrugs and says it&#x2019;s part of ranching, but I hurt for my animals. I lifted the rifle and in my mind drew an <i>X</i> on her skull, midpoint between both eyes and the base of both horns. It isn&#x2019;t kind to do it poorly.The shot was loud in my ears, echoing as the cow slumped and went quiet. Then I sat between my dead cow and her dead calf, right there in the scrabble and brush, pulled up my knees, and cried. These last three years have seemed like an eternity of drought and poor harvest and dying animals. My boys are off at school, and to tell the truth, it&#x2019;s cheaper to send them to town, where they can pick up work, than to feed them here. I need money and I need rain. Both of them in good order and flowing over.After a while, I coiled Mary Pearl&#x2019;s rope and hung it over my shoulder. The rifle was heavy. My feet hurt. I beat the dust off my old hat, put it on my head, and started walking. I shook my head and didn&#x2019;t look back. The buzzards and the coyotes would have their day after all.<i>April 25, 1906</i>I knew soon as I spotted the riders and put names to them they were up to no good. I laid into the rug draped across my front porch rail with an iron beater, watching two men amble toward the house. Both were carrying good-size packs tied behind their saddles. It was early afternoon, and I had plenty of chores tallied to this day already. No sense waiting on a couple of slowpokes. I kept on whipping that rug, and let them get as close as the gate before I looked up and showed I&#x2019;d seen them coming. &#x201c;Charlie? Gilbert?&#x201d; I called. &#x201c;You two know what day it is?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, Mama,&#x201d; they said together. Charlie is twenty-one. Gilbert is but nineteen. My sons weren&#x2019;t due back from school for three weeks.&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you let me hear you&#x2019;ve failed out. I&#x2019;ll turn you out, to boot.&#x201d; I feared I knew the truth before they said it.Charlie spoke first. &#x201c;No, Mama. We haven&#x2019;t failed, either one of us. We just&#x2014;well, we changed our minds.&#x201d;I hit that rug two more licks. I said, &#x201c;Oh, you did?&#x201d; Charlie had been taking studies in engineering and mining. Gilbert was going to be a doctor.He said, &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;&#x201c;Both of you&#x2014;together&#x2014;changed your minds like they were one? What did you change them to?&#x201d; Felt like my eyeteeth had just come loose. There is a perfectly fine university right there in Tucson for them to use. A library full of books, some of which I put there myself, is just waiting for them to discover and love and enjoy it. And here they come like roosting pigeons. I shook all over, so mad I couldn&#x2019;t speak.Charlie stepped off his horse, holding his reins as if he was fixing to get back on.Gilbert was still on his horse. He, too, was debating whether just to keep riding. He finally said, &#x201c;Well, Mama, you don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know what hard work is like. You have a privilege not many get&#x2014;to use your minds instead of your backs&#x2014;and you turn away from it, like ... like it was tedious.&#x201d;Charlie scratched the animal&#x2019;s head between the ears and said, &#x201c;We want to be ranchers. Like you and Grampa. We aren&#x2019;t cut out for that place.&#x201d;I found myself fussing at his back. &#x201c;How will you know what you are cut out for if you don&#x2019;t try? Charlie, you were only a year and this term from finishing. This ranch will be here when you are done. Mount up and get back there. Tell your teachers you&#x2019;re sorry for being knotheads, and make up your work.&#x201d;&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t that easy,&#x201d; Charlie said, finally turning around to face me. He held the saddle in both hands. &#x201c;I missed the final examination in geology today. I&#x2019;d have to do the whole term again anyway. They just make it so hard on you, you can&#x2019;t get above water. Besides, all the science professor talks about is diamond mines in Africa. I&#x2019;ve turned enough rocks here to make a mountain, and there sure aren&#x2019;t diamonds under &#x2019;em. School&#x2019;s a waste of time when there&#x2019;s plenty of work to do here.&#x201d;I said, &#x201c;You two seemed to have time enough for plenty of other shenanigans. I heard about the armless saguaro some hooligans planted right in front of the main stairs. Looks like a blessed giant finger stuck in the ground&#x2014;in front of a <i>university.</i> It doesn&#x2019;t take a scholar to figure who might have been part of that.&#x201d;Gilbert finally dismounted, turned his face toward his saddle. He was barely hiding a grin, but still scared to look me in the eye. I said, &#x201c;I reckon there&#x2019;s some reason you&#x2019;re tagging along.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2014;well, I reckoned I&#x2019;d think it over awhile. Doctors hardly make enough money to keep a pot of beans on the stove. I&#x2019;d rather do something that puts some jingle in my pockets. Why, a vanilla drummer makes as much as a doctor, and he doesn&#x2019;t have to study chemistry or cut open cadavers.&#x201d; He eyed that rug beater in my hands as he smiled.All my life, I&#x2019;ve ached for the chance to sit in a real schoolroom, but I never got the privilege. I set myself to lay into them, but I&#x2019;d as soon argue with the daylight. They&#x2019;d already done what they meant to do. Maybe I never went to school, but I reckon I&#x2019;m smart enough to know when I&#x2019;m licked. Licked for now maybe, but not finished with this fight. So I said, &#x201c;How are your cousins?&#x201d; Savannah and Albert&#x2019;s twin girls and second son&#x2014;Rachel, Rebeccah, and Joshua&#x2014;the ones these two were supposed to be sharing my house in town with. The ones who&#x2019;d stayed in school. &#x201c;You say hello to your aunt and uncle as you rode in?&#x201d; My brother and his wife and family lived just a scant mile up the road from me.I could see the boys let their shoulders down. They knew they&#x2019;d won this go-round. Gilbert took the pack off his horse and began loosening the saddle&#x2019;s cinch strap. At the same time, both of them said, &#x201c;Fine. They&#x2019;re all just fine,&#x201d; mumbling something or other about Rachel&#x2019;s cooking.&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s cadavers?&#x201d; I said.Gilbert said, &#x201c;Dead folks. <i>Pickled</i> dead folks. After the second one, well&#x2014;&#x201d;I headed toward the house, saying over my shoulder, &#x201c;Well, if you hadn&#x2019;t got the stomach for that, you hadn&#x2019;t. Come on in, and I&#x2019;ll feed you. Put those animals in the west corral. Pillbox just foaled, and I don&#x2019;t want you in the barn, upsetting her.&#x201d;Even from the porch, I could see in their eyes that they were smiling, although they knew better than to look smart in front of me. One thing I know is that you can&#x2019;t let up on boys. Just because they&#x2019;re big as a man, you give them any slack, and they&#x2019;ll run sidelong into trouble. I&#x2019;m about fed up with these two, I thought. Reckon I&#x2019;ll make them some lunches, and then figure what to do with them. Might as well invite Albert and Savannah and the rest for supper tonight, let them know the two renegades are back. Sorry rascals.There&#x2019;s a single cloud in the sky. It looks pretty sickly, and I doubt it will prove its mettle. We as much as missed the spring rains. Maybe the summer&#x2019;s wet weather will come early, and get some grass growing before we go broke buying feed for cattle that already look like walking beef jerky.My sons were still tending their horses when Ezra and Zachary, Albert&#x2019;s youngest boys, came along. They had a cord of some sort stretched tight between them and they trotted in circles around each other. They were each toting a slate and a book under one arm. Their bare feet stirred up dust as they came.&#x201c;Aunt Sarah,&#x201d; Ezra called, &#x201c;watch us. Watch! Planetary motion.&#x201d; They whirled up the road, and Ezra howled as if he were the wind; then he jerked the string hard and tugged his little brother forward.I laughed. Ezra and Zachary are my last two students, and I don&#x2019;t aim to short them on their readiness for the university.As they got to the house, Zack was running with all his might. They both stopped at my front steps. Zack put his hands on his knees to catch his breath. He gasped, &#x201c;You sorry old buzzard, Ezra. I told you to slow down. I&#x2019;m played clear out.&#x201d;I called through the kitchen window, &#x201c;Both of you come on in. Ezra, you&#x2019;ll have to do your recitation first, so Zack can have enough wind to say his piece.&#x201d; Ezra moaned and followed Zack to the parlor, where they dropped to the floor and fanned themselves with their slates. I said, &#x201c;Your cousins are home from town. We&#x2019;re all going to eat first, and then you can do your lessons.&#x201d;Ezra said, &#x201c;Can we go see &#x2019;em? May we? I mean.&#x201d;I said, &#x201c;Nope. Just cool off in here. They&#x2019;ll be in directly.&#x201d;Almost the minute I&#x2019;d said it, Charlie and Gilbert came at a near run to the house and flung wide the door.Charlie said, &#x201c;Mama, are you sick?&#x201d;My sons&#x2019; faces bore childlike expressions of fear. Ezra and Zack cheered and howled at the sight of them, mindless of their cousins&#x2019; worried looks. I had to raise my voice to be heard over the commotion. &#x201c;Nothing of the kind,&#x201d; I said.Charlie said, &#x201c;When we put the saddles away, we saw old Mr. Sparky had been moved. Went to see what he was sitting on.&#x201d;Mr. Sparky was what I reckon you&#x2019;d call a toy. A scarecrow, topped off with a skull the boys had been given when the army shut down Fort Lowell and folks turned it into a marketplace. The telegrapher used to keep an old human skull in the office with glass eyeballs plugged into the eye holes and the snaggletoothed chinbone spring-wired to the ticker line. When a message came in, that jaw would ratchet up and down and the eyes would roll in their sockets. Indians would come for miles around just to set and wait for a message, then hoot and roll with laughter at the thing. After Jack died, some of the men at the fort sort of kept an eye on my boys when we were in town, and one of them rode clear out here to see if Charlie wanted Sparky when they left. I&#x2019;d laughed and told him it wasn&#x2019;t like a puppy, but Charlie was happy, and later he and Gilbert took some clothes they&#x2019;d both outgrown and stuffed Mr. Sparky a body.Halloweens, Sparky keeps guard duty at the outhouse for us, which saves it being turned over like most of the other privies around. Other times, he appears now and then, just for the fun of it. Once, I got up on a Christmas morning to find what looked like a saddle tramp snoozing under a sombrero in a rocking chair on the front porch, his boots sticking from under an old blanket. About the time I guessed the old cuss was dead and started to use a stick to lift the sombrero, one of Sparky&#x2019;s glass eyeballs fell out and rolled across the porch. Gilbert and Charlie were laughing so hard at the corner of the house,...</p><h2>Gifts of Wisdom from Helen Exley: Taking Time to Just Be (HE-71473)</h2><p>Taking Time Just to Be is about taking time out from our busy, over-complicated lives to sit, to appreciate our home, to breathe and to be at one with nature: To just be.

Those men are honored in this collection of evocatively understated photographs showing all 70 of the city's affected firehouses, from Red Hook's company of "Happy Hookers" to Harlem's "Fire Factory." The pictures by 50 noted photographers show the firehouses in all attitudes of mourning and recovery, crowded with donated flowers, candles, homemade signs, and children's drawings (some from as far as Mississippi) that have helped buoy up the survivors in the months since the attack. These displays are evidence of a popular rediscovery of firefighters, writes McCourt in his pitch-perfect foreword to the book. All of September 11's FDNY dead are listed delicately across the bottom of the pages of portraits of the lost men's firehouse beds, wall-posters, empty lockers, boots, and heat-darkened helmets, as well as their squad mates struggling on. The iconic buildings in which these rescuers died were themselves memorialized in last fall's The World Trade Center Remembered, a thinking-person's remembrance with an elegant text by architecture critic Paul Goldberger. In that work, the towers lord over the island with their old swagger; the blue-sky backgrounds are not yet ominous, the buildings' steel skins not yet gashed and smoking. Taken together, these two books express a reflective stillness before and after catastrophic horror. They are the class of the many publishing tributes and will serve any reader looking for memorial literature that doesn't patronize or wear a blood shirt. [Proceeds from Brotherhood go to the New York Firefighters 911 Relief Fund. Ed.] Nathan Ward, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.On 9-11, the most indispensable people at ground zero were New York's firefighters, as pretty much everyone has acknowledged. The headquarters building of American Express was across the street from the World Trade Center, and 11 employees died in the towers. With this book, the company honors the firefighters who died trying to save those 11 and the others. Near the bottom of its pages, beginning on the front endpapers, the names of the lost run in a single line that continues to the back endpapers. The entire roster appears three times, over as well as under brilliant color photographs of the stations that lost those men, their remaining comrades, the ad hoc shrines a grateful citizenry assembled to honor the fallen, and the appreciative artwork and letters that children sent to the stations. In terms of effect, the pictures beggar the brief accompanying remarks of Mayor Giuliani, Fire Commissioner Von Essen, and eulogist Frank McCourt, and they ensure the big book's place in the forefront of 9-11 commemoratives. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With a wealth of wisdom on practical issues, this book offers information on a variety of topics such as public art planning, funding, and governance; establishing legal agreements with artists; and commissioning single artworks or creating comprehensive art programs. <p>Since the earliest monuments and memorials were installed in the United States, definitions of public art have continued to evolve. Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency saw the creation of the Works Progress Administration and the beginning of comprehensive federally sponsored art programs, and 1950s Philadelphia became the first city to pass percent-for-art legislation. As artists have turned their attention toward creating in the public realm rather than simply placing their art in public spaces, public art has assumed a much broader role in community life than ever before. Since the 1990s, the public art resources available to artists and their communities have greatly expanded.Today there are more than three hundred government-funded public art programs in the United States, in addition to scores of public-private partnerships and private agencies creating art in public spaces. </p><p><i>Public Art by the Book</i> is the definitive resource for information on public art for local government, arts agencies, arts professionals, and artists themselves. Examples included are cited from cities such as Charlotte, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, and Seattle.</p><p><b>Barbara Goldstein</b> is public art program director for San Jose's Office of Cultural Affairs.</p></p><p><p>A nuts and bolts guide for arts professionals and volunteers creating public art in their communities, with information on planning, funding, and legal issues.</p><b>Barbara Goldstein </b>is public art program director for San Jose's Office of Cultural Affairs.</p><h2>Wallace D.

A central figure in the Latin Boom, Garc�a M�rquez was the most celebrated practitioner of the literary style that has become known as magic realism, and in 1982, received the highest literary achievement: the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p><p>Chilean poet and Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda called <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>, &#x201c;the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since Don Quixote of Cervantes.&#x201d; In the <em>New York Times</em> legendary critic John Leonard proclaimed, &#x201c;with a single bound, Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez leaps onto the stage with G�nter Grass and Vladimir Nabokov.&#x201d; And writer William Kennedy has hailed Garc�a M�rquez&#x2019;s masterpiece as, &#x201c;the first piece of literature since the <em>Book of Genesis</em> that should be required reading for the entire human race.

A rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, it tells the story of the mythical town of Macondo through the lives of seven generations of the doomed Buend�a family. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend�as, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p><p>Alternately reverential and comical, <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> interweaves the political, personal, and spiritual, bringing a new consciousness to storytelling; this radiant work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p><p>This special edition is a re-designed jacketed hardcover featuring colored endpapers in a beautiful, elegant slipcase.</p></p><p><i>"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend�a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."</i><p> It is typical of Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez that it will be many pages before his narrative circles back to the ice, and many chapters before the hero of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, Buend�a, stands before the firing squad. In between, he recounts such wonders as an entire town struck with insomnia, a woman who ascends to heaven while hanging laundry, and a suicide that defies the laws of physics: </p><blockquote> A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, made a right angle at the Buend�a house, went in under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining-room table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen under Amaranta's chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano Jos�, and went through the pantry and came out in the kitchen, where �rsula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread.<br> "Holy Mother of God!" �rsula shouted. </blockquote><p> The story follows 100 years in the life of Macondo, a village founded by Jos� Arcadio Buend�a and occupied by descendants all sporting variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, Jos� Arcadio and Aureliano, and grandsons, Aureliano Jos�, Aureliano Segundo, and Jos� Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the women--the two �rsulas, a handful of Remedios, Fernanda, and Pilar--who struggle to remain grounded even as their menfolk build castles in the air. If it is possible for a novel to be highly comic and deeply tragic at the same time, then <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> does the trick. Civil war rages throughout, hearts break, dreams shatter, and lives are lost, yet the effect is literary pentimento, with sorrow's outlines bleeding through the vibrant colors of Garc�a M�rquez's magical realism. Consider, for example, the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, whom Jos� Arcadio Buend�a has killed in a fight. So lonely is the man's shade that it haunts Buend�a's house, searching anxiously for water with which to clean its wound. Buend�a's wife, �rsula, is so moved that "the next time she saw the dead man uncovering the pots on the stove she understood what he was looking for, and from then on she placed water jugs all about the house." </p><p> With <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez introduced Latin American literature to a world-wide readership. Translated into more than two dozen languages, his brilliant novel of love and loss in Macondo stands at the apex of 20th-century literature. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>In 1967, <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> launched Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez to international fame and cemented his reputation as a literary legend.

Rebellious, radical and romantic, Wood was determined to be an artist.

James Wolcott, contributing writer to <em>Vanity Fair</em>, calls Terry Castle a &#x201c;Jedi knight of literary exploration and lesbian scholarship,&#x201d; and <em>The Professor and Other Writings</em> &#x201c;a greatest-hits package of show-stopping monologues and offhand-genius riffs.&#x201d; <em>The Professor and Other Writings</em> is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of gender, identity, and sexuality in the grand tradition of such feminist luminaries as Susan Sontag, Camille Paglia, and Joan Didion.</p></p><p><p>From one of America's most brilliant critics and cultural commentators comes a long-awaited collection of penetrating autobiographical essays and a riveting short memoir, novelistic in style and ambition, about the pathos, comedy, and devastation of early love.</p><p>Stanford professor and longtime contributor to the <em>London Review of Books</em>, the <em>Atlantic</em>, the <em>New Republic</em>, <em>Slate</em>, and other publications, Terry Castle is widely admired for the wit, panache, intellectual breadth, and emotional honesty of her writings on life, literature, and art. Now, at long last, she has collected some of the more personal of her recent essays in a single volume. Several pieces here are already acknowledged classics: "Desperately Seeking Susan," the celebrated account she wrote in 2005 of her droll and somewhat bittersweet friendship with Susan Sontag; "My Heroin Christmas," a darkly humorous examination of addiction, her family and stepsiblings, and the late, great jazz saxophonist Art Pepper; and the picaresque "Travels with My Mother," a rollicking travelogue that brings together Castle's complicated relationship with her mother, lesbianism, art, and the difficult yet transcendent work of the painter Agnes Martin.</p><p>At the center of the collection, however, is the title work, published here for the first time: a candid and wrenching exploration of Castle's relationship, during her graduate school years, with a female professor. At once hilarious and rueful, it is a pitch-perfect recollection of the fiascos of youth: how we come to own (or disown) our sexuality; how we understand (or don't) the emotional needs and wishes of others; how the ordeals of desire can prompt a lifelong search for self-understanding.</p><p>In this account of a sentimental education, as in all the essays in <em>The Professor and Other Writings</em>, Terry Castle reveals herself as a truly remarkable writer: utterly distinctive, wise, frank, and fearless.</p><p>Terry Castle was once described by Susan Sontag as "the most expressive, most enlightening literary critic at large today."

Originally a priest of the Church of England, his interest in spiritualism caused him to end his affiliation with Anglicanism in favour of the Theosophical Society, where he became an associate of Annie Besant. He became a high-ranking officer of the society, but resigned in 1906 after accusations that he had engaged in sex (mutual masturbation) with teenage boys in his care.

And haunting nightmares keep slowing Cara down: nightmares of Beloved, enemy of the unicorns; of the father whose legacy she turned against; and of the mother who deserted her.<br><br>In order for Cara to complete her mission and accept her destiny it will take not only trust and belief, but the love of a surprising ally as well.</p><p>Prolific children's book author Bruce Coville has delivered a down-to-earth unicorn tale, if such a thing is possible. <i>Song of the Wanderer</i>, the second book in The Unicorn Chronicles, delivers a neat follow-up to <i>Into the Land of the Unicorns</i>, unraveling mysteries and handily reweaving new ones just as fast. The world of the unicorns, Luster, is carefully and cohesively imagined, with myths and rules and prejudices that seem logical and organic. Readers will thrill to the story of Cara, an earth girl who becomes both ward and savior of the unicorns. She must travel through Luster--a world replete with all manner of secret caves and rainbow prisons and talking seashells--back to earth to try to find her grandmother, the Wanderer. The episodic structure of the book is satisfying; Coville delivers all the de rigueur scenes, including a makeover, wherein a Geomancer provides Cara with clothing appropriate to her journey: "To finish the outfit, she strapped a short sword to Cara's side. 'May you never have to use it,' whispered the Geomancer." (The rest of us hope otherwise.) Coville hurries his heroine past some flat characterizations through clever, well-thought-out plot points. And he leaves his ending compellingly open, as befits a series: Luster resounds with rumors of "the possibility of a fierce, final battle that would decide the ancient struggle between the unicorns and the Hunters once and for all." Stay tuned, unicorn lovers. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Song of The Wanderer is a multi-voiced recording featuring author Bruce Coville himself as narrator and a talented group of actors who bring to life the each of the fantastical creatures in a way that will delight young and old alike.

Pascal Zachary is a senior writer at the Wall Street Journal.

In evaluating the man's legacy, he honors Bush as a role model for his generation's engaged engineers. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Thomas P. Hughes</i><br><br>This book provides a framework for understanding the incredible changes wrought in U.S. society by the power and influence of government-backed scientific and technological research. It does this by profiling Vannevar Bush, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineer who, as head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), oversaw all wartime military research. He mobilized the nation's scientific and technological talent by funding private research with public funds. He also had the brass to stand up to conservative military leaders and force them to adopt new hardware, such as radar. Author G. Pascal Zachary does a good job of personalizing Bush, who could be decidedly unappealing. The scientist was such an elitist that he questioned whether the United States could continue as a democracy in the post-World War II era. But Zachary also presents a portrait of a dedicated patriot who agonized over his involvement in the wartime carpet-bombings of Germany and Japan. Above all, Bush emerges as a clear thinker who knew how to seize power and wasn't afraid to wield it. This is an important book--not necessarily for the details of Bush's life, but for the view it gives us of how the science/technology establishment grew. This is Vannevar Bush's true legacy, as the person who engineered it. Zachary tells the story with stylistic grace and meticulous attention to detail. -- <i>Upside, Cliff Barney</i><br><br>Vannevar Bush is best known for his 1945 essay <i>As We May Think</i>, which described an imaginary, automated system to link together all of humanity's knowledge. It was a system, in short, that prefigured hypertext and the Web by almost 50 years. But this visionary essay was really just a footnote to the life of a man.... <i>Endless Frontier</i> ... describes how Bush stamped his indelible imprint on our times. But, the ironic coda to this story is that after having helped create the military-industrial complex that defined the postwar era, Bush was deeply unhappy with what he had wrought. Here, Zachary becomes most eloquent, almost elegiacal. -- <i>Wired, Steve G.

It is ridiculously easy for a single person with a bomb-filled backpack, or a single explosives-laden automobile, to launch an attack. So why hasn't it happened? The answer is surely not the Department of Homeland Security, which cannot stop terrorists from entering the country, legally or otherwise. It is surely not the Iraq war, which has stoked the hatred of Muslim extremists around the world and wasted many thousands of lives. Terrorist attacks have been regular events for many years -- usually killing handfuls of people, occasionally more than that. <p>Is it possible that there is a simple explanation for the peaceful American homefront? Is it possible that <i>there are no al-Qaeda terrorists here</i>? Is it possible that the war on terror has been a radical overreaction to a rare event? Consider: 80,000 Arab and Muslim immigrants have been subjected to fingerprinting and registration, and more than 5,000 foreign nationals have been imprisoned -- yet there has not been a single conviction for a terrorist crime in America. A handful of plots -- some deadly, some intercepted -- have plagued Europe and elsewhere, and even so, the death toll has been modest.</p><p>We have gone to war in two countries and killed tens of thousands of people. We have launched a massive domestic wiretapping program and created vast databases of information once considered private. Politicians and pundits have berated us about national security and patriotic duty, while encroaching our freedoms and sending thousands of young men off to die.</p><p>It is time to consider the hypothesis that dare not speak its name: we have wildly overreacted. Terrorism has been used by murderous groups for many decades, yet even including 9/11, the odds of an American being killed by international terrorism are microscopic. In general, international terrorism doesn't do much damage when considered in almost any reasonable context.</p><p>The capacity of al-Qaeda or of any similar group to do damage in the United States pales in comparison to the capacity other dedicated enemies, particularly international Communism, have possessed in the past. Lashing out at the terrorist threat is frequently an exercise in self-flagellation because it is usually more expensive than the terrorist attack itself and because it gives the terrorists exactly what they are looking for. Much, probably most, of the money and effort expended on counterterrorism since 2001 (and before, for that matter) has been wasted.</p><p>The terrorism industry and its allies in the White House and Congress have preyed on our fears and caused enormous damage. It is time to rethink the entire enterprise and spend much smaller amounts on only those things that do matter: intelligence, law enforcement, and disruption of radical groups overseas. Above all, it is time to stop playing into the terrorists' hands, by fear-mongering and helping spread terror itself.</p></p><p><b>John Mueller</b> holds the Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies, Mershon Center, and is professor of Political Science at Ohio State University, where he teaches courses in international relations. <p>He is the author of several classic works of political science and many editorial page columns and articles in <i>The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, The New Republic, Reason, The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>.</p><p>Mueller is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, has been a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow, and has received grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

"I can't imagine bin Laden trying to blow up the mermaids," he mused, "but with terrorists, who knows what they're thinking. I don't want to think like a terrorist, but what if the terrorists try to poison the water at Weeki Wachee Springs?"</p><p>Whatever his imaginings, however, he went on to report that his enterprise had quickly and creatively risen to the occasion -- or seized the opportunity. They were working to get a chunk of the counterterrorism funds allocated to the region by the well-endowed, anxiety-provoking, ever-watchful Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Which is the greater threat: terrorism, or our reaction against it? The Weeki Wachee experience illustrates the problem. A threat that is real but likely to prove to be of limited scope has been massively, perhaps even fancifully, inflated to produce widespread and unjustified anxiety. This process has then led to wasteful, even self-parodic expenditures and policy overreactions, ones that not only very often do more harm and cost more money than anything the terrorists have accomplished, but play into their hands.</p><p>The way terrorism anxiety has come to envelop the nation is also illustrated by a casual exchange on television's <i>60 Minutes</i>. In an interview, filmmaker-provocateur Michael Moore happened to remark, "The chances of any of us dying in a terrorist incident is very, very, very small," and his interviewer, Bob Simon, promptly admonished, "But no one sees the world like that." Remarkably, both statements are true -- the first only a bit more so than the second. It is the thesis of this book that our reaction against terrorism has caused more harm than the threat warrants -- not just to civil liberties, not just to the economy, but even to human lives. And our reaction has often helped the terrorists more than it has hurt them. It is the reactive consequences stemming from Simon's perspective -- or from what journalist Mark Bowden has characterized as "housewives in Iowa . . . watching TV afraid that al-Qaeda's going to charge in their front door" -- that generate one of the chief problems presented by terrorism.</p><p>International terrorism generally kills a few hundred people a year worldwide -- not much more, usually, than the number who drown yearly in bathtubs in the United States. Americans worry intensely about "another 9/11," but if one of these were to occur every three months for the next five years, the chance of being killed in one of them is 0.02 percent. Astronomer Alan Harris has calculated that at present rates, the lifetime probability that a resident of the globe will die at the hands of international terrorists is 1 in 80,000, about the same likelihood that one would die over the same interval from the impact on the earth of an especially ill-directed asteroid or comet.</p><p>But such numbers are almost never discussed: Moore's outburst is exceedingly rare. Instead, most Americans seem to have developed a false sense of insecurity about terrorism. Thus, since 9/11, over a period in which there have been no international terror attacks whatever in the United States and in which an individual's chances of being killed by a terrorist have remained microscopic even if one -- or many -- did occur, nearly half of the population has continually expressed worry that they or a member of their family will become a victim of terrorism, as Figure 1 shows. Moreover, when asked if they consider another terrorist attack likely in the United States within the next several months, fewer than 10 percent of Americans usually respond with what has proven to be the correct answer: "Not at all likely." Yet, this group has not notably increased in size despite continual confirmation of its prescience.</p><p>That the costs of terrorism chiefly arise from fear and from overwrought responses holds even for the tragic events of September 11, 2001, which constituted by far the most destructive set of terrorist acts in history and resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. The economic costs of reaction have been much higher than those inflicted by the terrorists even in that record-shattering episode, and considerably more than 3,000 Americans have died since 9/11 because, out of fear, they drove in cars rather than flew in airplanes, or because they were swept into wars made politically possible by the terrorist events.</p><p>Moreover, as terrorist kingpin and devil du jour Osama bin Laden has gleefully noted, fear, alarmism, and overreaction suit the terrorists' agenda just fine because they create the damaging consequences the terrorists seek but are unable to perpetrate on their own. As he put it mockingly in a videotaped message in 2004, it is "easy for us to provoke and bait. . . . All that we have to do is to send two mujahidin . . . to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaeda in order to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses." His policy, he extravagantly believes, is one of "bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy," and it is one that depends on overreaction by the target: he triumphally points to the fact that the 9/11 terrorist attacks cost al-Qaeda $500,000, while the attack and its aftermath inflicted, he claims, a cost of more than $500 billion on the United States. Shortly after 9/11, he crowed, "America is full of fear from its north to its south, from its west ot its east. Thank God for that."</p><p></p><p><b>PRESENTING AN UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTIONAL WISDOM</b></p><p>In exploring these issues, this book develops three themes, in this order: (1) terrorism's threat, while real, has been much overblown, something that aids terrorist aims; (2) this process is a familiar one since, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that many international threats have been considerably inflated in the past; and (3) applying these lessons, policy toward terrorism should very substantially focus on reducing the damaging fears and overreactions terrorism so routinely fosters.</p><p>In the process, I present a considerable number of propositions that, it seems to me, should be -- but decidedly aren't -- the conventional wisdom on this subject. These propositions are certainly susceptible to debate and to reasoned criticism, but it seems to me that they, rather than their hysterical if attention-grabbing opposites, ought to be the base from which the discussion proceeds. At the very least, they should be part of the policy discussion mix, but they seem almost entirely to have been ignored.</p><p>Among these propositions are the following:</p><ul><p> </p><li>In general, terrorism, particularly international terrorism, doesn't do much damage when considered in almost any reasonable context.</li><p> </p><li>Although airplanes can still be blown up, another attack like the one on 9/11 is virtually impossible. In 2001 the hijackers had the element of surprise working for them: previous hijackings (including one conducted by Muslim terrorists six months earlier) had mostly been fairly harmless as the perpetrators generally landed the planes somewhere and released, or were forced to release, the passengers. After the 9/11 experience, passengers and crew will fight to prevent a takeover, as was shown on the fourth plane on 9/11.</li><p> </p><li>The likelihood that any individual American will be killed in a terrorist event is microscopic.</li><p> </p><li>Just about any damage terrorists are likely to be able to perpetrate can be readily absorbed. To deem the threat an "existential" one is somewhere between extravagant and absurd.</li><p> </p><li>The capacity of al-Qaeda or of any similar group to do damage in the United States pales in comparison to the capacity other dedicated enemies, particularly international communism, have possessed in the past.</li><p> </p><li>Lashing out at the terrorist threat is frequently an exercise in self-flagellation because it is usually more expensive than the terrorist attack itself and because it gives the terrorists exactly what they are looking for.</li><p> </p><li>Chemical and radiological weapons, and most biological ones as well, are incapable of perpetrating mass destruction.</li><p> </p><li>The likelihood that a terrorist group will be able to master nuclear weapons any time soon is extremely, perhaps vanishingly, small.</li><p> </p><li>Although murderous and dedicated, al-Qaeda is a very small and very extreme group, and it is unlikely by itself to have the capacity for taking over any significant government.</li><p> </p><li>Al-Qaeda's terrorist efforts on 9/11 and in the years since have been substantially counterproductive.</li><p> </p><li> Although additional terrorist attacks in the United States certainly remain possible, an entirely plausible explanation for the fact that there have been none since 2001 is that there is no significant international terrorist presence within the country.</li><p> </p><li>Policies that continually, or even occasionally, focus entirely on worst-case scenarios (or worst-case fantasies) are unwise and can be exceedingly wasteful.</li><p> </p><li>In fact, much, probably most of the money and effort expended on counterterrorism since 2001 (and before, for that matter) has been wasted.</li><p> </p><li>Seeking to protect all potential targets against terrorist attack is impossible and foolish. In fact, just about anything is a potential target.</li><p> </p><li>Terrorism should be treated essentially as a criminal problem calling mainly for the application of policing methods, particularly in the international sphere, not military ones.</li><p> </p><li>Because terrorism probably presents only a rather limited threat, a viable policy approach might center around creating the potential to absorb its direct effects and to mitigate its longer range consequences while continuing to support international policing efforts...</li></ul></p><h2>Havoc&#39;s Sword: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure</h2><p><p>Dewey Lambdin's lovable but incorrigible rogue, Captain Alan Lewrie, Royal Navy, is back to cut a wide and wicked swatch through the war-torn Caribbean in <i>Havoc's Sword</i>, an entirely new high seas adventure. </p><p>It's 1798, and Lewrie and his crew of the Proteus frigate have their work cut out for them. First, he has rashly vowed to uphold a friend's honor in a duel to the death. Second, he faces the horridly unwelcome arrival of HM Government's Foreign Office agents (out to use him as their cat's-paw in impossibly vaunting schemes against the French). And last, he must engineer the showdown with his arch foe and nemesis, the hideous ogre of the French Revolution's Terror, that clever fiend Guillaume Choundas!</p><p>We know Lewrie can fight, but can he be a diplomat, too? He must deal with the newly reborn United States Navy, that uneasy, unofficial "ally," and the stunning, life-altering surprise they bring. For good or ill, Lewrie's in the "quag" up to his neck this time. Can sword, pistol, and broadsides avail, or will words, low cunning, and Lewrie's irrepressible wit be the key to his victory and survival, as even the seas cry "Havoc"?</p></p><p><p><b>Dewey Lambdin</b> is the author of ten previous Alan Lewrie novels and an omnibus volume, <i>For King and Country</i>. A member of the U.S. Naval Institute and a Friend of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, he spends his free time working and sailing on a rather tatty old sloop, Wind Dancer. He makes his home in Nashville, Tennessee, but would much prefer Margaritaville or Murrell's Inlet.</p>In this solid seafaring historical, the 11th in Lambdin's Alan Lewrie series, British Royal Navy Captain Lewrie is tasked with hounding his longtime nemesis, the brutal and cunning French commander Guillaume Choudas. Choudas has been sent to sow discord on the French Caribbean island of Hispaniola, where Toussaint L'Ouverture holds the reins of power after a slave rebellion in 1791. The British have a cockeyed scheme to back L'Ouverture's rival-in-arms, General Rigaud, against the rebellion's leader. Though opposed to the plan, Lewrie is under orders to support it. After harassing the French on his own, and killing one of Choudas's best captains, Lewrie covertly teams up with the newly minted American navy and lures the French Caribbean fleet into a trap. The American navy proves its mettle, badly mauling the French, and, after Lewrie has tricked Choudas once again with false information, the Americans capture the Frenchman. Lewrie and his Foreign Office spy compatriot, the highly competent Peel, go over the head of insipid regional spymaster Grenville Pelham to suggest further alliance with the Americans as a means toward British dominance of the Caribbean and Atlantic. Lambdin's villains are invariably either monsters or weasels, and Lewrie is never believably threatened by them, so there isn't much tension. But Lambdin's customary good humor, well-wrought naval battles and use of every ruse de guerre in the book provide enough moment-to-moment pleasure to keep this long-running adventure series afloat. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Right Side: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Brilliant.

The chair made a squeaky sound, intolerable to the woman sitting on the other side of the desk.

Daddy lifted the cooler lid, cracked open a cold one. The other side of the slope was very steep and rocky, all the way down to a dry wash with two cottonwoods growing along the near bank. An old rusted-out car shell was parked between the cottonwoods, if you could say parked about such a wheel-less ruin. But that was how it looked to LeAnne, like someone had been out driving and ended up parking in a shady spot on some long ago nice day for a spin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nineteen-forty-seven Buick Roadmaster. My uncle Rodney had one, if I remember right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Uncle Rodney?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Great uncle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s great about him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Christ. Just means . . . forget what it means. Doesn&#x2019;t matter. A hopeless juicer. Went boots up when I was just a kid, younger than you. Roadmaster was long departed by then. I only know from old photos.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I see them?&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy shook his head. &#x201c;All gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the fire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy tossed the empty into the cooler, helped himself to another cold one, and handed her one of those gingerbread men with mint-green eyes that Mom baked and LeAnne loved. The fire was a big deal in family history, burning down the house Daddy had grown up in, outside of Flagstaff, and killing his parents, meaning LeAnne&#x2019;s grandparents. Daddy was overseas at the time, just getting started in the service, and hadn&#x2019;t even met Mom yet, meaning this was way before LeAnne was born, so she&#x2019;d never known that set of grandparents. For different reasons, she didn&#x2019;t know the other set, either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Daddy said, taking a nice sip. &#x201c;Enough chitchat. Let&#x2019;s see what you can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just sitting like this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Daddy gestured down at the 1947 Buick Roadmaster. &#x201c;Right side taillight still intact?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s intact?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unbroken.&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne peered down. She had very sharp eyesight, according to Dr. Ralpundi, who did the preseason examinations for all the sports teams&#x2014;20/15 in her left eye, even better in her right. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Break it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The right, of course, was her shooting eye, although she kept the left open, Daddy-style. &#x201c;How else are you gonna know when someone comes after you outta left field?&#x201d; Which never failed to get her laughing, like suddenly baseball was turning up in your life.<br> <br>LeAnne raised Little P. &#x201c;Let the weapon find the target,&#x201d; Daddy always said. Also pretty funny, to LeAnne&#x2019;s way of thinking. Because how could it do that on its own? The weapon was just a thing. But she&#x2019;d learned early on that it turned out to be kind of true. She peered through the sight with her right eye, not looking at the distant taillight at all, just at the space inside the little V, let out every puff of her breath, stopped time, and in the moment before time would start up again, she pulled the trigger, pulling not being the right word. Pulling was too strong. This was more like the force you&#x2019;d use to press the thingamajig at the top of a ballpoint pen to make the tip stick out.<br> <br>Crack. But not a loud crack. This was only a .22, after all. Neither was there much in the way of recoil, just the slightest of kicks, like a baby in the mommy&#x2019;s tummy. Then came the soundless shattering of the taillight, and tiny red shards went flying in the sunshine. Real tiny, like solid blood drops. Weapon finds target.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; Daddy said.<br> <br>Then it got very quiet, middle-of-the-desert quiet mixed in with that quiet that comes when the shooting stops. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s the same one,&#x201d; LeAnne said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Great uncle Rodney&#x2019;s nineteen-forty-seven Buick Roadmaster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get a notion like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not mad. Why&#x2019;d I be mad? I&#x2019;m just saying where&#x2019;d you get the goddamn notion?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It popped up in my mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked down at her again. Then he rumpled her hair. &#x201c;Got a head of hair on you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom says there&#x2019;s nothing to be done with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She does, does she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A rat&#x2019;s nest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That what she calls it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy turned away, drained the cold one, tossed it in the cooler, and was reaching for another when he paused. &#x201c;Gimme that thing,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>LeAnne clicked the safety into place, handed him the .22.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe that is Rodney&#x2019;s old Roadmaster, after all,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Really, Daddy?&#x201d; She came close to jumping up and down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better odds than the lottery. Lottery&#x2019;s like millions to one. But the Roadmaster? Think about it. How many forty-seven&#x2019;s got sold in Arizona? A few thousand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So the odds would be a few thousand to one? Is that how you figure out odds?&#x201d;<br> <br>Daddy didn&#x2019;t answer. Instead, he stepped close to the edge of the ridge and yelled, &#x201c;Hey, Rodney! Heads up!&#x201d; And then, holding the .22 kind of casually, like Little P was only a toy, he took a series of shots, so quick it was almost like automatic fire, and a line of holes appeared all along the side of the Roadmaster, so perfectly and evenly spaced that they might have been part of the design.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Here you go,&#x201d; Dr. Machado said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; said LeAnne. She hadn&#x2019;t seen his approach&#x2014;he&#x2019;d come out of left field; actually, right. She took the coffee, didn&#x2019;t say thanks&#x2014;seemed like too much effort, plus who was this asshole anyway? And why was she here? She took a sip.<br> <br>&#x201c;Enough sugar?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>What was that supposed to mean? She foresaw a hot and splashy ending to this interview. If that was what it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Play any baseball?&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You. Baseball. Did you play?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Why do you ask?&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne shrugged. Then came silence&#x2014;not that anyplace in the hospital was ever silent, or even close&#x2014;while Dr. Machado sat back down on the other side of the desk. He looked at her. She looked at a framed photo on the wall behind him: Dr. Machado, smiling in a polo shirt, with wife and two little boys, all smiling, all in polo shirts. She considered asking him if he&#x2019;d played any polo.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about we begin at the beginning?&#x201d; Dr. Machado said.<br> <br>She turned to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;With your early life&#x2014;father and mother, where you grew up, et cetera.&#x201d;<br> <br>She kept herself from saying, Let&#x2019;s begin with et cetera but offered nothing in its stead.<br> <br>Dr. Machado riffled though some papers. His fingernails were in great shape, salon quality. She didn&#x2019;t want to think about hers, so she didn&#x2019;t. Kept her mind far distant from her fingernails, especially the two that were still growing back in.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see here that your father was also military. Master Sergeant Rex Hogan, Green Berets.&#x201d; Dr. Machado looked up. &#x201c;Tell me about him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much to tell,&#x201d; LeAnne said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Checking the dates here, he seems to have left the army when you were . . . what? Eight or nine? What sort of work did he do after that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t it say?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Machado nodded. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s always nice to confirm the written data.&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne had no interest in that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you describe your relationship with him?&#x201d; Dr. Machado went on. &#x201c;Or would you prefer to start somewhere else, with your mother, for example?&#x201d;<br> <br>LeAnne rose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d prefer to go back to my room. I have a headache.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Machado placed his hands flat on the desk. &#x201c;Sorry to hear that. We&#x2019;ll reschedule. Would you like me to get someone to help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Help me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Escort you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your room.&#x201d;<br> <br>He said it like: Where else? Yeah, she got that, got it good. She kept an eye&#x2014;ha!&#x2014;on his hands, flat on the desk: Yes, a complete asshole. Soft, soft hands. They reminded her, the way opposites sometimes will, of those hands that had appeared so suddenly out from under a burqa.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need any help,&#x201d; LeAnne said.</p><h2>Cold Hearts</h2><p>On a frosty January day in Bergen, private detective Varg Veum is visited by a prostitute whose friend has disappeared. Before her disappearance, something had unsettled her: she&#39;d turned away a customer and returned to the neighborhood in terror. Shortly after taking the case, Veum finds the first body - and it won&#39;t be the last either. His investigation leads him into a dark subculture where corrupted idealism has had deadly consequences. &#34;Veum can skillfully dole out violence, but the essentially humane detective prefers methods that involve dialogue and deduction, investigation and intellect- a welcome contrast to many in his line of work.&#34;--Publishers Weekly Sept. 9, 2013 &#34;Cold Hearts is top-tier Scandinavian crime fiction; straightforward dialogue drives the plot, and tough but sympathetic Veum is equally comfortable in a fistfight, proving for secrets behind Bergen&#39;s closed doors, or examining crime&#39;s sociological roots.&#34;--Booklist*, Nov. 1, 2013</p><p>Gunnar Staalesen, born in 1947 in Bergen, Norway, is a leading author of crime stories, which books have been translated into more than 12 languages and have twice won Norway&#39;s top crime prize, the Golden Pistol. EuroCrime published The Writing on the Wall in 2004.*Starred Review* Social worker turned private investigator Varg Veum is contemplating how he&#x2019;ll get enough business to get through the slow winter season in Bergen, Norway. Then Hege, a former classmate of Veum&#x2019;s son, hires the PI to find a missing friend. Both girls are prostitutes, and Hege is convinced that the police won&#x2019;t investigate Maggi&#x2019;s disappearance. Veum, however, knows the high-stakes world of the red-light district makes finding Maggi imperative, and he&#x2019;s soon knee deep in her life&#x2019;s unpleasantries. He begins exploring multiple avenues: the prostitute&#x2019;s menacing pimp, the pair of violent johns she refused, and the minefield of her troubled childhood. When bodies begin stacking up with connections to all three scenarios, Veum is certain Maggi&#x2019;s disappearance is related, but each clue creates a new layer of questions. Cold Hearts is top-tier Scandinavian crime fiction; straightforward dialogue drives the plot, and tough but sympathetic Veum is equally comfortable in a fistfight, probing for secrets behind Bergen&#x2019;s closed doors, or examining crime&#x2019;s sociological roots. Those attracted to the grudgingly humanistic investigators created by Michael Connelly, Jo Nesb�, Anne Holt, and Ken Bruen will embrace Varg Veum. Although this novel can stand alone, some American readers may be frustrated by having to read the series out of order; this is the fourteenth of 20 Varg Veum novels, but only the third released in the U.S. --Christine Tran</p><h2>They Were Counted (The Writing on the Wall: The Transylvanian Trilogy, 1)</h2><p>Painting an unrivalled portrait of the vanished world of pre-1914 Hungary, this story is told through the eyes of two young Transylvanian cousins, Count Balint Ab dy and Count L szl� Gyeroffy. Shooting parties in great country houses, turbulent scenes in parliament, and the luxury of life in Budapest provide the backdrop for this gripping, prescient novel, forming a chilling indictment of upper-class frivolity and political folly, in which good manners cloak indifference and brutality. Ab dy becomes aware of the plight of a group of Romanian mountain peasants and champions their cause, while Gyeroffy dissipates his resources at the gaming tables, mirroring the decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire itself. The first book in a trilogy published before World War II, it was rediscovered after the fall of Communism in Hungary and this edition contains a new foreword.</p><p>Miklos Banffy (1873-1950) was variously a diplomat, MP and foreign minister in 1921/22 when he signed the peace treaty with the United States and obtained Hungary&#39;s admission to the League of Nations.

His famous Transylvanian Trilogy, They Were Counted, They Were Found Wanting, They Were Divided was first published in Budapest in the 1930s.&#39;A genuine case of a rediscovered classic.

This very readable translation makes a wonderful book accessible to many more people&#39; - New Statesman&#39;My great find of the year is a reprint of the magnificent trilogy, set in pre-war Transylvania by Miklos Banffy...which stands comparison with the great Russian and French masters. Banffy vies with Tolstoy for sweep, Pasternak for romance and Tolstoy for evocation of nature; his fiction is packed with irresistible social detail and crammed with suberb characters: it is gloriously, addictively, compulsively readable&#39; - Caroline Moor, Books of the Year, Seven</p><h2>100 Bible Verses Everyone Should Know by Heart</h2><p>100 Bible Verses Everyone Should Know by Heart [paperback] [Jan 01, 2015] ... 1433689022</p><p></p><h2>The Screaming Staircase By Jonathan Stroud [Paperback]</h2><p>A sinister Problem has occurred in London: all nature of ghosts, haunts, spirits, and specters are appearing throughout the city, and they aren't exactly friendly.

Within days, Superintendent Roderick Alleyn is sent onboard, undercover, to find the culprit before he strikes again. James Saxon has a beautifully modulated voice. If you're a fan of the British mystery on audio, you'll have heard him before. His voice has aged well, like a fine, full-bodied wine. He plays the characters here as exaggerations of type: the repressed school teacher, the femme fatale, the lush TV actor well on his way to a nervous breakdown. His treatment paints the scenes with a broad brush but achieves the overall effect of a vivid story. D.G. � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Story of Time</h2><p>Exploring this elusive and often controversial subject, Umberto Eco, Sir Ernst Gombrich, and others contributes essays and reflections on the meaning of time.</p><p>This monumental publication is one of the most important, high-profile books published to mark the millennium, examining the very subject that gives the millennium its meaning: time. Multidisciplinary and cross-cultural in its subject-matter and approach, and all-encompassing in its scope, the book is written by an outstanding international cast of authors, including Umberto Eco and Sir Ernst Gombrich, each one a renowned expert from the fields of science, art, history, philosophy, or culture. <p>Lavishly illustrated with objects from all corners of the world, from ancient Egyptian and Babylonian calendars and Titian&#x2019;s allegories to the distorted-clock paintings of Salvador Dal� and recent photographs of deep space taken by the Hubble telescope, The Story of Time questions people&#x2019;s perceptions of time and reflects the many ways in which cultures around the world have responded to time, measured time, and expressed their understanding of time.</p>Just in time for the new millennium comes this enormous, amply illustrated compilation of 23 essays on aspects of time from experts in various disciplines, among them history and historiography, music, geology, literary criticism, anthropology, religion and the history of engineering. The venerated art historian E.H. Gombrich contributes a compact "History of Anniversaries," from the so-called "jubilee" of the Hebrew Bible through a famous 1769 "Shakespeare Jubilee" and on to our present glut of commemorations. John MacDonald's intriguing "Inuit Time" explains how traditional cultures of the North American Arctic taught their children to wake up early in the morning, and how newly Christian tribal communities (who had to know which day was the Sabbath) grappled with the alien concept of weeks. Lorne Campbell describes some temporal problems of portraiture, as when a slow-working painter finds that her subject's appearance has changed over multiple sittings. Jonathan Betts outlines "The Growth of Modern Timekeeping: From Pendulums to Atoms." And Umberto Eco zips from St. Augustine to the modern philosophy of language to the Millennium Bug in a typically provocative foreword. Three hundred color pictures and photos, many with long explanatory blurbs, portray such time-related items as Renaissance sundials and klepsydras (water-clocks), the Hindu god Vishnu (creator and destroyer of world and time) and a bizarre French clock from 1795, which indicated not only 60-minute hours and 24-hour days, but also the short-lived revolutionary system of decimal time, whose 10 hours a day had 100 minutes each. The entire enjoyable and visually impressive volume is timed to coincide with an exhibit at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, where the year 2000 will officially begin.

Back to McClellanville and the ocean. Back to my family.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m proud to be the son of a shrimper. While some men look at wide-open fields and think of planting, we McClellans stare out at the water and think of shrimp. Shrimping is hard work&#x2014;long hours laboring under a relentless sun, straining muscles against nets dragged from the sea bulging with shrimp. My hands bear scars from years of separating shrimp from bycatch. Backbreaking work&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and exhilarating. It&#x2019;s in our blood. Out on the water we&#x2019;re saltwater cowboys, untamed, unbridled, and free. Mavericks riding the water. I&#x2019;m proud to bear the McClellan name. For as long as I can remember, my father, Alistair&#x2014;everyone calls him the Captain&#x2014;has steered the Miss Jenny, named after my mother, the largest shrimp boat in the fleet. I worked on the Miss Jenny as soon as I could walk. That&#x2019;s the way it is in the business&#x2014;family pitches in.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m proud to wear the ring. I graduated from the Citadel in Charleston, the first man in my family to graduate from college. It&#x2019;s a rare sight to see one&#x2019;s father so proud his eyes tear up. Especially a sea-hardened man such as the Captain. I&#x2019;ll never forget it.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m proud to be a Marine. I&#x2019;m the son of a sailor and the most recent in a long line of men who&#x2019;ve served their country in foreign wars. After graduating I immediately entered the Corps as an officer. &#x201c;Dare to Lead&#x201d; the Citadel challenged us, and that&#x2019;s what I did. After training I shipped off to the Middle East to lead a platoon. Our mission was to maintain a defensive perimeter in Afghanistan. We patrolled a vast area of desert, seeking out contraband and insurgents, racing across burning sand in hot pursuit of smugglers with small caches of weapons and ordnance. Small villages yielded the same.<br> <br>You might not believe me, but the desert and the ocean are similar. They&#x2019;re both immense in a way that defies comprehension. I&#x2019;ve ridden in a Humvee across miles of endless sand under a merciless sun and sailed a shrimp boat on the dark sea when the dawn broke across the horizon, and in both places I felt the vastness. It made me feel small and insignificant. Isolated and alone. Both desert and sea are unforgiving terrain and don&#x2019;t tolerate fools.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m proud that I&#x2019;m a good leader. I don&#x2019;t say that with conceit. I say this so you understand why I feel the burden of guilt for being sent home while some of my men will never make it back.<br> <br>The Bible says that pride goeth before a fall. I&#x2019;m here to tell you that&#x2019;s true.<br> <br>Thanksgiving is over and the Christmas season is beginning. Instead of joy, however, I feel the terror of my war memories lurking inside my brain like one of those damned IEDs just waiting for the right trigger to explode and tear me apart, the way one did on a dusty Afghanistan road. The bomb shattered my bones and burned my body and soul. Yet they call me lucky.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m going home because the doctors say I&#x2019;m recovered. I can only shake my head and think, What fools. My fractured bones might be healed, but my brain certainly isn&#x2019;t. The scars in my mind are the wounds that cut the deepest. I didn&#x2019;t want to leave the hospital&#x2014;I felt safe there. I&#x2019;m more comfortable with other injured servicemen like me than I am with my family. But they said I had to leave, so I did. I got a cheap apartment near the hospital. I holed up, afraid to go out, to deal with the public. I grew isolated, lonely. The doctors told me to go see my family for the holidays. Where do you go but home when there&#x2019;s no place else to go? So, as the song says, I&#x2019;ll be home for Christmas.<br> <br>I feel as if I&#x2019;m heading for a fall.</p><h2>Rescue Princesses #12: The Golden Shell (12)</h2><p>These are no ordinary princesses-- they're Rescue Princesses!<br><br>The Rescue Princesses are going to Princess School!

Anastacia Rene�'s FORGET IT draws the reader into the churning seas of dissolution &#x2014; marriage, family, identity, livelihood &#x2014; in language unknotted from the constraints of punctuation, syntax, sense&#x2014; "eaten into seedless cherries"&#x2014;and plunged into the fabular scape/scope of dreams, myth, fairytales, faith, race. Phantom births, ghosts, half-grown children, sex, betrayal, violence, anger, female body, the bloody aftermaths of dissolution sprawling, placental and umbilical, in the urgent, haunted language of dreaming and memory. City and speaker dissolve into one another, boundaries vanquished. What remains after dissolution? Talking to herself. From whence do (k)new form(s) arise?

When Sparrowhawk, the Archmage of Earthsea, returns from the dark land stripped of his magic powers, he finds refuge with the aging widow Tenar and a crippled girl child who carries an unknown destiny.</p><p>Ursula K. LeGuin follows her classic trilogy from Earthsea with a magical tale that won the 1991 Nebula Award for Science Fiction. Unlike the tales in the trilogy, this novel is short and concise, yet it is by no means simplistic. Promoted as a children's book because of the awards garnered in that category by her previous work, <b>Tehanu</b> transcends classification and shows the wizardry of female magic. The story involves a middle-age widow who sets out to visit her dying mentor and eventually cares for his favorite student.Classics of high fantasy, Ursula K. Le Guin's three previous Earthsea novels--A <i>W izard Of Earthsea</i>, <i>The Tombs Of Atuan</i>, and <i>The Farthest Shore</i>--have been compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and C.S Lewis' <i>Narnia</i> stories as being among the genre's greatest creations. Now the fourth and final volume, <i>Tehanu</i>, brings to a conclusion the remarkable Earthsea cycle with a revelation of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry. Once she'd been a priestess, quest-companion to a powerful mage, a student of high magic. Then she gave it all up to be a farmer's wife on Gont, content to lead a simple life. But Tenar was not born to live her days in peace, away from great events. A dying wizard and an abused child were the first to call her back to the path she had abandoned. For the end of the adventure beckoned and Tenar would be there along with the dragons, mages, and the young king himself to share in the unforgettable fate of the kingdom known as Earthsea.<p></p><p>"A tale with the universality and dignity of legend . . . .

Vasarely&#39;s experimentation with optical effects in the 1940s and 50s earned him a central role in the evolution of Op Art. By the late 50s and early 60s, he concentrated on the &#34;democratization of art&#34; by no longer producing his works as expensive originals but in large editions of affordable screen prints; this attempt to redefine the position and function of the artist in society was an important first step in the Pop Art movement.

The result is a fastpaced, moving, yet authoritative account of the people caught up in the fallout of Booth's mad act.

Matthew Desmond does just that with <em>Evicted</em> as he explores the stories of tenants and landlords in the poorest areas of Milwaukee during 2008 and 2009. It&#x2019;s almost always a compliment to say that a nonfiction book reads like a novel and this one does &#x2013; mostly because Desmond gets very close to the &#x201c;characters,&#x201d; relating their words and thoughts and layering on enough vibrant details to make every rented property or trailer come alive. You can almost forget that these are actual people with actual problems until he delivers a raw jolt of reality: the woman who&#x2019;s evicted because her boyfriend beats her up; the tenant whose baby daughter dies in a house fire; the tenant who pushes a &#x201c;friend&#x201d; out a window for using all her cell phone minutes; the landlord who refuses to fix stopped-up pipes, so tenants allow garbage and sewage to pile up in the property. <p>Through both personal stories and data, Desmond proves that eviction undermines self, family, and community, bearing down disproportionately hard on women with children. In Milwaukee, being behind on rent gives landlords the opening to serve an eviction notice, which leads to a court date. On the face of it, it may seem easy to side with the landlords&#x2014;of course tenants should pay their rent. But as <em>Evicted</em> pulls back layer after layer, what&#x2019;s exposed is a cycle of hurt that all parties&#x2014;landlord, tenant, city&#x2014;inflict on one another. Whether readers agree with Desmond&#x2019;s conclusions for how to break this cycle in order to strengthen families and neighborhoods, it&#x2019;s obvious by the end of <em>Evicted</em> that there is no easy fix, and that people&#x2014;some addicts, some criminals&#x2014;will slip through the cracks. But it should be just as obvious that we must still try. </p><em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang</em><b>Matthew Desmond</b>&nbsp;is the John L.

At the center of the case was self-described King of Kings, Galleon's founder Raj Rajaratnam, a Sri-Lankan-born, Wharton-educated billionaire. But the most shocking allegation was that the �minence grise of Indian business, Rajat Gupta, was Rajaratnam's accomplice and mole.

The two of them were waiting in <i>Chrysalis II</i>&#x2019;s departure lounge for the torch ship from the Earth/Moon system to dock at the habitat. No one else was in the departure lounge; no one else from the habitat was heading for Jupiter.<br>They did not look much like father and daughter. George was a huge bushy mountain of a man, with a tangled mop of brick red hair and a thick unruly beard to match, both bearing the first telltale streaks of silver. Deirdre was almost as tall as he, but seemed dwarfed next to him. She was strikingly beautiful, though, with wide innocent almond eyes that had a slight oriental cast to them and high cheekbones, thanks to her mother. She had her father&#x2019;s strong jaw and auburn hair that glowed like molten copper as it streamed down past her shoulders. She was wearing a simple pullover blouse and comfortable slacks, but they couldn&#x2019;t hide the supple curves of her ample figure.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll miss my retirement party,&#x201d; George growled.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about that,&#x201d; Deirdre said. &#x201c;But they promised me a full scholarship to the Sorbonne if I&#x2019;d put in a year at the research station in Jupiter orbit. A full scholarship, Daddy!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On Earth.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes! On Earth!&#x201d;<br>George shook his shaggy head. &#x201c;Earth&#x2019;s a dangerous place. Too many people. All sorts of diseases and maniacs runnin&#x2019; around.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Daddy, it&#x2019;s <i>Earth</i>!&#x201d; Deirdre exclaimed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s civilization. It&#x2019;s culture. I don&#x2019;t want to spend my whole life cooped up in this habitat. I know you love it, but I want to see the real world!&#x201d;<br>George muttered something too low for his daughter to catch.<br>George Ambrose had been director of the rock rats&#x2019; habitat orbiting the asteroid Ceres for the past quarter century. He had helped build the original <i>Chrysalis</i> for the miners and prospectors who combed the Asteroid Belt in search of the metals and minerals that fed the human race&#x2019;s expansion through the solar system. He had directed the building of <i>Chrysalis II</i> when the rock rats&#x2019; first habitat had been destroyed in the Asteroid Wars.<br>And he had presided over the trial of the mercenary killer who had wiped out the original habitat.<br>Now he stood with his only daughter scowling at the display screen that spread across one entire bulkhead of the departure lounge. It showed the long, sleek torch ship from Earth making the final delicate maneuvers of its rendezvous with the slowly revolving wheel of the habitat. George saw tiny puffs of cold gas squirting from the ship&#x2019;s maneuvering rockets: thruster farts, he said to himself.<br>Like most of the habitat, the departure lounge was strictly utilitarian: a row of hard benches ran along its facing gray bulkheads, the scuffed, dull heavy steel hatch of the airlock between them. No windows; the only outside view was from the wide display screen that stretched above one of the benches.<br>Across from the wall screen, though, was a mural that Deirdre had painted as a teenager, a seascape she had copied from memory after studying a docudrama about Earth&#x2019;s oceans. Deirdre&#x2019;s murals decorated many of the otherwise drab sections of the habitat: Even the crude, gaudy daubings she had done as a child still remained on the otherwise colorless bulkheads of <i>Chrysalis II</i>. They were little better than graffiti, but her father would not permit anyone to remove them. He was proud of his daughter&#x2019;s artistry, which had grown deeper and richer as she herself blossomed into adulthood.<br>But George was not admiring his daughter&#x2019;s artwork now. Still staring at the display screen, he impatiently called out, &#x201c;Screen, show Ceres.&#x201d;<br>The display obediently shifted from the approaching torch ship to show the cratered, dusty rock of the asteroid around which the habitat orbited. Largest of the &#x2019;roids in the Belt, Ceres was barely a thousand kilometers across, an oversized boulder, dusty, pitted, dead. Beyond its curving limb there was nothing but the dark emptiness of infinity, laced with hard pinpoints of stars bright enough to shine through the camera&#x2019;s protective filters.<br>Big George clasped his hands behind his back as he stared at the unblinking stars.<br>&#x201c;I only came out here to get rich quick and then go back to Earth,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;Never thought I&#x2019;d spend the rest of my fookin&#x2019; life in the Belt.&#x201d;<br>Deirdre gave her father a sympathetic smile. &#x201c;You can go back Earthside any time you want to.&#x201d;<br>He shook his shaggy head. &#x201c;Nah. Been away too long. I&#x2019;d be a stranger there. Leastways, I got some friends here....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tons of friends,&#x201d; Deirdre said.<br>&#x201c;And your mother&#x2019;s ashes.&#x201d;<br>Deirdre nodded. Mom&#x2019;s been dead for nearly five years, she thought, but he still mourns her.<br>&#x201c;You can visit me on Earth,&#x201d; she said brightly. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be a total stranger.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, without enthusiasm. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I really have to go on this ship, Daddy. I&#x2019;ve got to get to Jupiter; otherwise I won&#x2019;t get the scholarship.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I could send you to school on Earth, if that&#x2019;s what you want. I can afford it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I want,&#x201d; she said gently. &#x201c;And now I can get it without putting the burden on you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That ship&#x2019;ll be burning out to Jupiter at one full <i>g,</i> y&#x2019;know,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;Six times heavier than here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve put in tons of hours in the centrifuge, Daddy. I can handle it. The station orbiting Jupiter is one-sixth gravity, just like here.&#x201d;<br>George nodded absently. Deirdre thought he had run out of objections.<br>They felt the slightest of tremors and the speaker built into the overhead announced, &#x201c;DOCKING COMPLETED.&#x201d;<br>George looked almost startled. &#x201c;I guess I never thought about you leavin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have to go, sooner or later.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, I know, but...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want me to go...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d; He shook his head fiercely. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to get stuck here the rest o&#x2019; your life, like me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back, Dad.&#x201d;<br>George shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big world out there. Lots of things to see and do. Lots of places for a bright young woman to make a life for herself.&#x201d;<br>Deirdre didn&#x2019;t know what to say.<br>His scowl returning, George said, &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t let any of those sweet-talkin&#x2019; blokes take advantage of you. Hear?&#x201d;<br>She broke into a giggle. &#x201c;Oh, Daddy, I know how to take care of myself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah. Maybe. But I won&#x2019;t be there to protect you, y&#x2019;know.&#x201d;<br>Deirdre grabbed him by his unkempt beard with both hands, the way she had since she&#x2019;d been a baby, and pecked at his cheek.<br>&#x201c;I love you, Daddy.&#x201d;<br>George blushed. But he clasped his daughter by both shoulders and kissed her solidly on the forehead. &#x201c;I love you, Dee Dee.&#x201d;<br>The airlock hatch swung open with a sighing puff of overly warm air. A short, sour-faced Asian man in a deep blue uniform trimmed with an officer&#x2019;s gold braid stepped through and snapped, &#x201c;Deirdre Ambrose?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This way,&#x201d; the Asian said, gesturing curtly toward the passageway beyond the airlock hatch.<br>George Ambrose watched his only child disappear into the passageway, the first step on her journey to Jupiter. And then to Earth. I&#x2019;ll never see her again, he thought. Never.<br>Then he muttered, &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see why they need a fookin&#x2019; microbiologist.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Ben Bova</p><h2>Superman Vol. 1: What Price Tomorrow?

He was the last man to hit .400 in a single season, a 19-time All-Star, a two-time American League MVP, a two-time winner of the Triple Crown, and an inductee into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966 . . . all while serving his country in World War II and the Korean War. <br><br>Far from a conventional biography, <i>Facing Ted Williams</i> aims to offer a different perspective with testimonials from teammates and opponents alike, on how Williams was regarded among his peers. See Ted Williams through the eyes of pitchers struggling to put a fastball past his bat, the infielders and outfielders adjusting their positions in the hopes that they can fill the hole where a frozen rope might land, and the catchers strategizing a Williams at-bat, pitch-by-pitch.&nbsp;<i></i><br><br><i>Facing Ted Williams</i> provides riveting insights from many baseball legends, including Hall of Famer Bob Feller; 1956 World Series MVP Don Larsen; and 1952 American League MVP Bobby Shantz; as well as many others.<br>Whether you&#x2019;re a Red Sox fanatic, a casual baseball fan, or perhaps just an admirer of the fabled war hero and slugger, this book is sure to be a fresh and compelling look at this classic baseball icon.

Remote viewing is a controversial psychic technique whose best-known proponent is Ed Dames, founder of a company called PSI TECH. Dames trained Brown in remote viewing. Though both Dames and Brown assert that aliens are currently involved with humanity in complex ways, it's worth noting that Dames dissociated himself from Brown when Brown's previous book, Cosmic Voyages, was published, believing that Brown had forsaken "scientific" technique for channeling. Here, Brown extends his story, begun in Cosmic Voyages, about the destruction of an ancient Martian civilization by natural disaster, the rescue of its survivors by the highly advanced Grey aliens, the creation of an underground Martian base in New Mexico and the Greys' need for human genetic material to further their spiritual progress. Now, it appears that a subspace war is raging between the Greys and a race of Reptilian ETs. Before getting there, however, readers must slog through a mind-numbing 60-page methodological overview of scientific remote viewing intended to convince them that the book is grounded in solid scientific procedure. But Brown's digressions into "soul communication" and "subspace mind," and his complete inattention to the impossibility of verifying his claims, undermine all pretensions to scientific rigor. Statements like "[Buddha] currently has a leadership role in the Galactic Federation" provide occasional comic relief. But only readers with an advanced ability to suspend disbelief will be able to take Brown's work seriously. (July) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc."I am quite impressed with Dr. Courtney Brown's timely research on extraterrestrials as presented in <i>Cosmic Explorers</i>. The data may seem very far out, but with our new consciousness-based science drawn from recent advances in the interpretation of quantum physics, the data are supported by some of our theories." -- <i>Amit Goswami, Ph.D., Professor of Theoretical Physics, University of Oregon</i><br><br>"In <i>Cosmic Explorers</i> Dr. Brown...clearly explains the mechanics by which scientific remote viewing is accomplished, presents verifiable demonstrations of the process, and then continues his quest to investigate extraterrestrial life." -- <i>Richard Moore, M.D.</i></p><h2>Doodle Flute</h2><p>Kevin Spoon, a wealthy kid who gets everything he wants, learns a lesson about the value of ownership when he is given a doodle flute by Mason Mintz, but is not told how to play it</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- A modern-day parable about friendship and sharing. Kevin Spoon has just about everything a boy could want: his own TV, a stereo, a VCR, a computer. He even has purebred guppies. What he doesn't have is a doodle flute. Mason Mintz, the weird kid up the street, has one, but he's not willing to sell it or to trade it for any of Kevin's many possessions. He is, however, willing to give Kevin the doodle flute for nothing, something Kevin can't figure out. The message is clear: doodle flutes, like friendship, must be freely given. Short sentences are used to create a deadpan humor that should appeal to reluctant readers. "Mason Mintz. . . took something out of his back pocket. It looked dumb. 'It looks dumb,' Kevin Spoon said." Vibrant colored-marker illustrations add a zany visual humor that should attract Bart Simpson fans. Share this with hard-boiled primary graders who think they've outgrown picture books; they'll be hooked. --Ruth Smith, Chicago Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.``Kevin Spoon had a nice life...his own VCR...his own computer ...pizza every day''--a kid's perfect dream. Mason Mintz ``wore cheap sneakers,'' and his parents grew pumpkins in the back yard. Still, Mason's doodle flute is unique, and he won't sell it or trade it. He'll give it to Kevin--but then it won't be his, so he can't play it--or show Kevin how. Solution: sharing. Pinkwater's mock-simplistic, tongue-in-cheek telling is quietly hilarious; his deft caricatures extend the joke. A telling fable that older kids will also enjoy.

Her novel <i>Strange Weather in Tokyo</i> was shortlisted for the 2013 Man Asian Literary Prize and the 2014 International Foreign Fiction Prize. <i>Manazuru</i> won the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission prize. She lives in Japan, where she taught biology and is a member of the Science Fiction Research Association.<b>The Moon and the Batteries</b> <br><br> <p>HIS FULL NAME was Mr. Harutsuna Matsumoto, but I called him "Sensei." Not "Mr." or "Sir," just "Sensei."</p> <p>He was my Japanese teacher in high school. He wasn't my home-room teacher, and Japanese class didn't interest me much, so I didn't really remember him. Since graduation, I hadn't seen him for quite a while.</p> <p>Several years ago, we sat beside each other at a crowded bar near the train station, and after that, our paths would cross every now and then. That night, he was sitting at the counter, his back so straight it was almost concave.</p> <p>Taking my seat at the counter, I ordered "Tuna with fermented soybeans, fried lotus root, and salted shallots," while the old man next to me requested "Salted shallots, lotus root fries, and tuna with fermented soybeans" almost simultaneously. When I glanced over, I saw he was staring right back at me. I thought to myself, <i>Why do I know his face . ?</i> Sensei spoke.</p> <p>"Excuse me, are you Tsukiko Ornachi?"</p> <p>Stunned, I nodded in response.</p> <p>"I've spotted you here sometimes," Sensei said.</p> <p>"Is that right?" I answered vaguely, still looking at him. His white hair was carefully smoothed back, and he was wearing a starched white shirt with a gray vest. On the counter in front of him, there was a bottle of sake, a plate with a strip of dried whale meat, and a bowl that had a bit of <i>mozuku</i> seaweed left in it. I wondered who this old man was who shared the same taste as me, and an image of him standing at a teacher's podium floated through my mind.</p> <p>Sensei had always held an eraser in his hand when writing on the blackboard. He would write something in chalk, like the first line of <i>The Pillow Book</i> by Sei Shonagon: IN SPRING IT IS THE DAWN THAT IS MOST BEAUTIFUL. And then, not five minutes later, he would erase it. Even when he turned to lecture to his students, he would still hold on to the eraser, as if it was attached to his sinewy left hand.</p> <p>"It's unusual to see a woman alone in a place like this," Sensei said as he delicately poured vinegared miso over the last morsel of dried whale and brought it to his lips with his chopsticks.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied, pouring beer into my glass. I had identified him as one of my high school teachers, but I still couldn't recall his name. As I drained my glass, part of me marveled that he could remember the name of a particular student, and part of me was puzzled.</p> <p>"Didn't you wear your hair in braids during high school?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I recognized you as soon as I saw you here."</p> <p>"Did you recently turn thirty-eight this year?"</p> <p>"I'm still only thirty-seven."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I beg your pardon."</p> <p>"Not at all."</p> <p>"I looked you up in the register and the yearbook, just to be sure." "I see."</p> <p>"You look just the same, you know."</p> <p>"You look just as well, Sensei." I called him "Sensei" to hide the fact that I didn't know his name. He has been "Sensei" ever since.</p> <p>That evening, we drank five bottles of sake between us. Sensei paid the bill. The next time we saw each other at the bar and drank together, I treated. The third time, and every time thereafter, we got separate checks and paid for ourselves. That's how it went. We both seemed to be the type of person who liked to stop in every so often at the local bar. Our food preferences weren't the only things we shared; we had a similar rhythm, or temperament. Despite the more than thirty-year difference in our ages, I felt much more familiar with him than with friends my own age.</p> <br><br> <p>I WENT TO Sensei's house several times. Every so often we would leave our usual bar to drink at a second place, and then we would go our separate ways home. But the few times we got as far as a third or fourth bar, we inevitably ended up having the final drink at Sensei's house.</p> <p>"I live nearby, why don't you come over?" Sensei said the first time he invited me to his home, and I felt a twinge of reticence. I had heard that his wife had passed away. The idea of spending time at a widower's home was slightly off-putting, but once I've started drinking, not much can stop me, so I went along.</p> <p>It was more cluttered than I had imagined. I had thought his place would be immaculate, but there were things piled up in every dark corner. Just off the hall, a carpeted room with an old sofa was absolutely silent and gave no hint of the books and writing paper and newspapers strewn about the adjacent tatami room.</p> <p>Sensei pulled out the low dining table and took a large bottle of sake from among the things in a corner of the room. He filled two different-sized teacups to the brim.</p> <p>"Please have a drink," Sensei said before he headed off to the kitchen. The tatami room gave onto a garden. Only one of the rain shutters was open. Through the glass door I could see the vague shape of tree branches. Since they were not in flower, I couldn't tell what kind of trees they were. I've never known much about plants.</p> <br><br> <p>"What kind of trees are those in the garden?" I asked Sensei as he carried in a tray with flakes of salmon and <i>kaki no tane</i> rice crackers. "They're all cherry trees," he answered.</p> <p>"All cherry trees?"</p> <p>"Yes, all of them. My wife loved them.</p> <p>"They must be beautiful in the spring."</p> <p>"They are crawling with insects. In the fall there are dead leaves all over the place, and in winter the bare branches are bleak and dreary," Sensei said without any particular distaste. </p><p>"The moon is out tonight." A hazy half-moon hung high in the sky.</p> <p>Sensei took one of the rice crackers and tilted his teacup as he refilled it with sake. "My wife was the kind of person who didn't think things through."</p> <p>"I see."</p> <p>"She just loved the things she loved, and hated the things shc hated."</p> <p>"These <i>kaki no tane</i> are from Niigata. They're good and spicy."</p> <p>The piquant burn of the crackers really did go quite well with sake. I sat there silently for a while, eating them with my fingers. Something fluttered in a treetop outside. It must have been a bird. I heard a faint chirping and the sound of the leaves on the branches rustling for a moment, and then it was quiet again.</p> <p>"Are there birds' nests?" I asked, but there was no answer. I turned around, and Sensei was gazing at a newspaper. Not today's paper, but one that he had randomly taken from the ones strewn about. He was intently reading a page from the foreign news service that had a photograph of a woman in a bathing suit. He seemed to have forgotten that I was there.</p> <p>"Sensei," I called, but still there was no response. He was completely absorbed.</p> <p>"Sensei," I said again in a loud voice. Sensei looked up.</p> <p>"Would you like to read the newspaper, Tsukiko?" he asked me abruptly. Without waiting for me to reply, Sensei laid the open paper on the tatami, slid open the fusuma, and went into the next room. He came back carrying several things he had taken from an old bureau. They were small pieces of pottery. Sensei made a few trips back and forth between this and the next room.</p> <p>"Yes, here they are." Sensei crinkled the corners of his eyes, carefully lining up the ceramics on the tatami. They each had a handle, a lid, and a spout. "Look at them!"</p> <p>"I see." But what <i>were</i> they? I stared at them, thinking to myself that I had seen something like these before. They were all roughly made. Were they teapots? But they were so small.</p> <p>"These are railway teapots," Sensei said.</p> <p>"Railway teapots?"</p> <p>"These are from trips I took. I bought box lunches at the station or on the train that came with these teapots. Now the teapots are plastic, but they used to sell them with ceramic railway teapots like these."</p> <p>There were more than a dozen railway teapots lined up. Some were amber-colored, some were other pale shades. They were all different shapes. This one had a large spout, that one a big handle, this pot had a tiny lid, that pot was fat and round.</p> <p>"Do you collect them?" I asked, and Sensei shook his head.</p> <p>"They just came with the box lunches I bought while I was on whatever trip I was taking.</p> <p>"This one is from the year I started university, when I was traveling around Shinshu. Here is one from when I went to Nara with a colleague during summer vacation&#x2015;I got off the train at one point to get lunch in the station for both of us, and the train departed just as I was about to get back on! That one was bought in Odawara on my honeymoon&#x2015;my wife carried it for the whole trip, wrapped in newspaper and stuffed among the clothes in her suitcase, so that it wouldn't break," Sensei explained, pointing to each of the railway teapots lined up in a row. I could only nod and murmur a response to each story.</p> <p>"I hear there are people who collect these kinds of things." "Is that why you still have them?"</p> <p>"Of course not! I would never engage in such crazy whims!" Crinkling his eyes again, Sensei went on to say, "I was simply showing you some things that I've had for a very long time.</p> <p>"I just can't seem to throw anything away," Sensei said, going again to the room next door and this time bringing back several small plastic bags.</p> <p>"See here . . . ," he said as he untied the knot at the opening of one of the plastic bags. He took out what was inside, which were all old batteries. Each of them had written on the side things like ELECTRIC SHAVER, WALL CLOCK, RADIO, Or FLASHLIGHT in black magic marker. He took a size-C battery in his hand.</p> <p>"This battery is from the year of the Ise Bay typhoon. The typhoon hit Tokyo much harder than expected, and that summer I used up the batteries in my flashlight."</p> <p>He went on, explaining, "The first cassette recorder I ever bought required eight C batteries, which it ate right through. I would listen to Beethoven's symphonies over and over again, and I used up the batteries in just a few days! Of course, I couldn't keep all eight batteries, so I decided to just save one, which I picked out from the bunch with my eyes closed."</p></p><h2>A Mind at Peace</h2><p><p>Set on the eve of World War II, <i>A Mind at Peace</i> captures the anxieties of a Turkish family facing the difficult reality entrenched in the early republic, founded on the ashes of the Ottoman Empire in 1923.

Daneel. The two must travel to Solaria, where no human has gone in over a thousand years! Reacting in fear against the technological superiority of the Outer Worlds, the people of Earth have hidden themselves in vast underground cities, nursing a hatred for Spacers. The fifty Outer Worlds of the Spacers together are home to fewer people than planet Earth. And home to many, many more robots. Earthmen hate Spacer robots, too...But Baley doesn&#39;t. He once had a robot partner, R. Daneel- and when the authorities of the planet Solaria request terrestrial assistance in investigating a murder, Baley is once again teamed with Daneel. He is the first Earthman in a millennium to travel to the Outer Worlds...and he must endure the glare of a sun far more deadly than Earth&#39;s.</p><p>A millennium into the future, two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the Galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. On the beautiful Outer World planet of Solaria, a handful of human colonists lead a hermit-like existence, their every need attended to by their faithful robot servants. To this strange and provocative planet comes Detective Elijah Baley, sent from the streets of New York with his positronic partner, the robot R. Daneel Olivaw, to solve an incredible murder that has rocked Solaria to its foundations. The victim had been so reclusive that he appeared to his associates only through holographic projection. Yet someone had gotten close enough to bludgeon him to death while robots looked on. Now Baley and Olivaw are faced with two clear impossibilities: Either the Solarian was killed by one of his robots--unthinkable under the laws of Robotics--or he was killed by the woman who loved him so much that she never came into his presence!Isaac Asimov, world maestro of science fiction, was born in Russia near Smolensk in 1920 and was brought to the United States by his parents three years later. He grew up in Brooklyn where he went to grammar school and at the age of eight he gained his citizen papers. A remarkable memory helped him finish high school before he was sixteen. He then went on to Columbia University and resolved to become a chemist rather than follow the medical career his father had in mind for him. He graduated in chemistry and after a short spell in the Army he gained his doctorate in 1949 and qualified as an instructor in biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine where he became Associate Professor in 1955, doing research in nucleic acid. Increasingly, however, the pressures of chemical research conflicted with his aspirations in the literary field, and in 1958 he retired to full-time authorship while retaining his connection with the University. Asimov&#39;s fantastic career as a science fiction writer began in 1939 with the appearance of a short story, `Marooned Off Vesta&#39;, in Amazing Stories. Thereafter he became a regular contributor to the leading SF magazines of the day including Astounding, Astonishing Stories, Super Science Stories and Galaxy. He won the Hugo Award four times and the Nebula Award once. With nearly five hundred books to his credit and several hundred articles, Asimov&#39;s output was prolific by any standards. Apart from his many world-famous science fiction works, Asimov also wrote highly successful detective mystery stories, a four-volume History of North America, a two-volume Guide to the Bible, a biographical dictionary, encyclopaedias, textbooks and an impressive list of books on many aspects of science, as well as two volumes of autobiography. Isaac Asimov died in 1992 at the age of 72.</p><h2>For King and Country: British Airborne Uniforms, Insignia &amp; Equipment in World War II � 1st Airborne Division � 6th Airborne Division � 1st Polish ... Brigade (Schiffer Military History Book)</h2><p>For King and Country is the first in a series of in-depth studies which will cover the uniforms, equipment, insignia, weapons, vehicles, and personal items of the British and Commonwealth soldier of World War II. This initial volume covers the British Airborne soldier of the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions, and the 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade. With over 540 color recreation, and detail photos and over 65 unpublished war era black and white photographs, the complete airborne rig is covered in great detail. For King and Country brings to life the British Airborne soldier as never before. Each branch of the Airborne is covered: included are the paratroops, glider troops, divisional and administrative departments, and the glider pilots, as well as those liaison and attached troops. For King and Country is an essential reference for any military enthusiast, collector, reenactor, modeler, and veteran.</p><p>&#34;The British Airborne troops of World War 2 have an outstanding reputation. They were made famous by their exploits on D-Day, Arnhem and the Rhine Crossing (Operation Varsity). Although their exploits are famous and there is much literature on them there is in comparison a significant lack of high-quality information on their uniforms, insignia and equipment. This outstanding book fills this information deficiency and it is a superb publication. As an Airborne re-enactor and military enthusiast, I require highly-detailed books on these aspects of the Airborne forces. This book is simply excellent and was written by a fellow re-enactor. It has chapters on the history of the Parachute Brigade, the Airlanding Brigade, the Glider Pilot Regiment and their support troops. Most people when thinking about the Airborne troops often neglect the important role of the Airlanding Brigade. These men arrived into battle by glider and were often transferred from their parent infantry regiments (battalions) to the Airborne troops. Unlike the Parachute Brigade they were not all volunteers. Naturally their insignia differentiated them from other troops and the author gives many detailed examples of their specialist insignia and combinations of insignia. The Airborne troops also had specialist uniforms and equipment. Their clothing was different from ordinary troops and many examples of them are presented in this highly picture graphic book. Overall this book comes highly recommended both for Airborne enthusiasts and re-enactors. If you are a serious student of this topic then this book is a definite must-have as there are simply no rivals at this high standard of research.

Ressler is retired from the F.B.I. and is now associate director for Forensic Behavioral Services in Virginia.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>The Study of Murder</b> </p><p> Interpersonal violence spans a wide range of human behaviors of which murder represents one of the terminal disruptions in the equilibrium of a society. Sexual homicide, a crime of increasing concern in our society, is the killing of a person in the context of power, sexuality, and brutality. Such crimes often receive widespread publicity, and they create a great deal of fear because of their apparent random and motiveless nature. Particularly in cases of serial sexual homicide, law enforcement officials feel public pressure to apprehend the perpetrator as quickly as possible. </p><p> Apprehension of the sexual murderer is one of law enforcement's most difficult challenges. Because sexual killings often appear motiveless and random, they offer few clues about why the murder occurred or, consequently, about the identity of the murderer. Even the sexual nature of these murders is not always immediately obvious, for conventional evidence of a sexual crime may be absent from a crime scene. </p><p> <b>The Scope of the Problem</b> </p><p> The number of sexual homicides occurring in a given year is difficult to assess, partially because of the manner in which crimes are investigated. In obvious cases of sexual assault and murder, the crime most often is reported as a homicide, not as a rape assault (Brownmiller 1975; MacDonald 1971). In other cases, conclusive evidence of sexual assault may be inadequate or lacking (Groth and Burgess 1977). Investigators may not recognize the underlying sexual dynamics of what appear to be either ordinary or motiveless murders (Cormier and Simons 1969; Revitch 1965). In addition, investigators often fail to share their findings, limiting the collective pool of knowledge on the subject (Ressler et al. 1980). </p><p> The difficulty in determining the scope of the problem of sexual homicide is reflected in official reports on murder. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) publication, <i>Crime in the United States,</i> presents statistics for crimes committed in the United States within a given year. For example, a survey of the statistics in the UCR for all murders committed in the period 1976 through 1986 shows that the number of murders in the United States has fluctuated from 16,605 in 1976 to a peak of 21,860 in 1980, dropping to 20,613 in 1986 <i>(Crime in the United States</i> 1986). The UCR also gives information about age, race, and sex of victims and offenders, about types of weapons used, and about situations in which killings took place. However, there is no differentiation in these official reports between homicides that included initially undetected sexual assault and those that did not. </p><p> The dearth of incidence statistics for sexual homicide promotes other approaches to evaluating this crime's magnitude. One of these approaches is to examine statistics for murders with unknown motives as indicators of the sexual homicide. Murder with unknown motive is one of five homicide categories for which the UCR annually provides data. These categories are as follows: </p><p> 1. Felony murder (occurs during the commission of a felony).<br> 2. Suspected felony murder (elements of felony are present).<br> 3. Argument-motivated murder (noncriminally motivated).<br> 4. Other motives or circumstances (any known motivation that is not included in previous categories).<br> 5. Unknown motives (motive fits into none of the above categories). </p><p> Because sexual homicide so often appears random, motiveless, and with its sexual aspects obscured, some experts argue that many sexual homicides may be reported in the unknown motive category. </p><p> Figures for most categories of motives, except the unknown category, have remained relatively stable over the past decade. For example, felony-connected murders represented 17.7 percent of all murders in 1976, 17.2 percent in 1981, 18.0 percent in 1984, and 19.4 percent in 1986. The percentages for those murders placed in the "other" category are as follows: 1976, 18.6 percent; 1981, 17.1 percent; 1984, 17.6 percent, and 1986, 18.6 percent. </p><p> However, the number of murders committed for unknown motives has risen dramatically. These murders represented 8.5 percent of all murders in 1976, 17.8 percent in 1981, 22.1 percent in 1984, and 22.5 percent in 1986. This trend is of particular interest in the study of sexual homicide. Opinion has varied on the importance of this problem. Sociologists Wolfgang and Ferracuti proposed that the vast majority of murders are committed for a specific reason and that "probably less than 5 percent of all known killings are premeditated, planned, and intentional" (1982, 189). On the other hand, in a 1969 article psychiatrists Cormier and Simons cite studies observing that dangerous sexual offenses are both rare phenomena and nonescalating in aggression; in contrast, their data suggest that sexual murderers may be more common than we wish to acknowledge and that they do in fact have progressively violent records. The rapid increase in the unknown motive category, while most categories have held relatively steady, is an indication that the Wolfgang and Ferracuti proposition, first noted in 1967, may no longer be valid. Reporting methods for the unknown motive category have remained constant since 1976 and thus do not account for the dramatic increase in motiveless murder. </p><p> Although the incidence of sexual homicide may be difficult to ascertain, its effects are less unclear. Many sexual homicides are difficult to solve precisely because of the lack of clues. Law enforcement investigators note that solution rates may be misleading and should be scrutinized closely, since some crimes reported as unsolved are, in fact, solved after the figures have been reported. It is the belief of both investigators and clinicians that the majority of serial murders are sexual in nature (Lunde 1976; Ressler et al. 1985; Revitch 1965). </p><p> Veteran investigators say that sexual homicide is not a new phenomenon, although its apparent increase is. Public awareness of the problem has also increased, largely because of news media attention to these often bizarre, sensational crimes. People fear these crimes precisely because of the seemingly random nature of the murders. </p><p> <b>Studies of Murder</b> </p><p> Because of society's view of murder as both abhorrent and pervasive, the many aspects of murder have been studied by various disciplines. Law enforcement, the newcomer to the research arena, has added over the past decade its growing expertise in crime scene analysis. </p><p> Studies of murder have offered different perspectives on this violent crime. Epidemiological studies report on demographic data concerning victims and perpetrators (Constantino et al. 1977) and patterns of homicide (Rushforth et al. 1977; Wolfgang 1958). All disciplines have tried to categorize murderers. They have been typed in terms of motive (Revitch 1965), intent (Kahn 1971), number of victims (Frazier 1974), and type of victim (Cormier and Simons 1969). However, the majority of studies do not specifically address sexual homicide but rather study murder without differentiating between sexual and nonsexual crimes (Perdue and Lester 1974). </p><p> Studies examining murder divide into the various disciplines focusing on the subject: (1) individual case reports by journalists, (2) studies of the psychological aspects of the individual who committed the murder, (3) studies investigating murder and murderers within a sociological context, (4) legal aspects of the crime, and (5) crime scene patterns. </p><p> <i>The Journalist's Perspective</i> </p><p> The first category represents a mass communication mechanism for informing the public of crimes being committed. As such, the possible mechanisms include newspapers, magazines, and books. The writers are usually journalists, and on occasion they may have additional training like Joseph Wambaugh, formerly a police detective, who wrote <i>The Onion Field,</i> which depicts the murder of a police officer. </p><p> The news of a murder in general and a sexual homicide in particular arouses strong emotion in the public. Newspaper headlines highlight the bizarre aspects ("Body-hack Case," "Vampire Killer's Trial Begins"), the victim ("The Victim's Last Hours"), the serial aspect ("Killer Strikes Again"), the outcome ("Next Stop: The Electric Chair") and the twenty-year anniversary ("July 14, 1966"). </p><p> Detective magazines are another mechanism for communication and often contain the facts learned at trial or during a journalist's investigation. In addition, journalists (Keyes 1976), as well as mental health professionals (Brussel 1968; Schreiber 1983), write books aimed at the general population. </p><p> <i>The Psychological View</i> </p><p> The second category includes studies that examine the individual murderer in terms of psychiatric diagnoses, childhood antecedents to criminal behavior, and criminal behavior as the result of learned responses to particular stimuli. Also in this category are studies designed to determine techniques for treating incarcerated violent offenders. </p><p> Study focus on the characteristics of individual murderers was evident as many as two hundred years ago. In the late eighteenth century, Swiss mystic Johann Kaspar Lavatar developed the art of physiognomy, whereby an individual's facial features were held to reveal his or her character. At about the same time, Franz Josef Gall contended that phrenology, the study of the formation of an individual's skull, could disclose both character and mental capacities. Physiognomy and phrenology were both used to study criminals, and death masks of murderers' heads were examined in an attempt to explain criminal acts (Attick 1970). </p><p> Among more recent theories that seek to explain violent human behavior through examination of individual physical characteristics is the approach based on the finding that certain violent criminals have a rare chromosomal abnormality called XYY (Jacobs, Brunton, and Melville 1965). According to this theory, the presence of an extra male, or Y, chromosome results in a greater likelihood that the individual will engage in aggressive and violent behavior. This idea received a great deal of attention in 1968, when it was reported that Richard Speck, the man who one night murdered eight student nurses, had the XYY abnormality. It was later found that Speck did not have the extra Y chromosome. Subsequent research demonstrated that although the XYY abnormality is four times more likely to show up in the male criminal population than in the general male population, most individuals with this condition display no abnormally violent behavior (Bootzin and Acocella 1980). </p><p> In the last decade, the field of psychiatry has paid increasing attention to brain function in all types of psychological problems. Neurological, genetic, and biophysiological components are being studied in the murderer (Lewis et al. 1986; Morrison 1981). </p><p> Psychological theories and explanations of violent behavior are substantially more common than those based on physical characteristics. As do studies based on individual physical attributes, these psychological studies focus on the characteristics of the individual murderer. According to Bootzin and Acocella (1980), psychological theories can be categorized as having either (1) a psychodynamic perspective (that unconscious childhood conflicts give rise to abnormal behavior), (2) a behavioral perspective (that inappropriate conditioning results in abnormal behavior), or (3) a humanistic-existential perspective (that abnormal behavior), results from a sense of personal failure). </p><p> Although individual-focused studies of violent behavior may be widely divergent in terms of their theoretical bases, they often have one thing in common: they group individuals into various categories. By producing taxonomic schemes to aid in understanding the causes of human violence, researchers seek to clarify methods of treating violent individuals and eliminating violent behavior. </p><p> Among recent general studies of human violence, several propose typologies having many categories. For example, Wille (1974) groups murderers into ten types: (1) depressives, (2) psychotics, (3) murderers with organic brain dysfunction, (4) psychopaths, (5) passive-aggressive individuals, (6) alcoholics, (7) hysterical personalities, (8) child killers, (9) mentally retarded murderers, and (10) murderers who kill for sexual satisfaction. In contrast, Guttmacher (1973) suggests six categories of murderers: (1) "average" murderers free from prominent psychopathology but lacking societal values, (2) sociopaths desiring revenge on the population at large for maltreatment during childhood, (3) alcoholics who kill their wives over fear of losing them, (4) murderers avenging a lover's loss of interest, (5) schizophrenics responding to hallucinations and delusions, and (6) sadists who kill to achieve sexual pleasure. </p><p> Other researchers have suggested fewer types of murderers. Megargee (1966) claims that there are only two types of extremely assaultive individuals (1) undercontrolled persons, who respond with aggression when frustrated or provoked, and (2) overcontrolled persons, who, despite rigid inhibitions against the expression of violence, build up an aggression that eventually results in violence. Simon (1977) studied thirty murderers and classified them into three groups: type A murderers had a tendency to murder impulsively, often with a weapon present and under the influence of alcohol. Type B murderers were more likely to be involved in a victim-induced homicide, with the victim usually a woman with whom the murderer had formed a relationship. Type AB murderers were able to sustain enduring, though sadistic, relationships with their victims and posed the greatest risk of future homicidal acts. Tanay (1972) has classified homicidal behavior into three categories: (1) ego-syntonic homicide, compatible with the offender's thinking and fulfills a consciously acceptable wish for the perpetrator; (2) ego-dystonic homicide, noncompatible with the offender's thinking and occurs against the conscious wishes of the perpetrator (who is in an altered state of consciousness); and (3) psychotic homicide, which occurs while the murderer is in a delusional state. </p><p> The few studies that specifically address sexual homicide suggest the existence of two types of sex murderers: the rape or displaced anger murderer (Cohen et al. 1971; Groth, Burgess, and Holmstrom, 1977; Prentky, Burgess, and Carter 1986; Rada 1978), and the sadistic, or lust, murderer (Becker and Abel 1978; Bromberg and Coyle 1974; Cohen et al. 1971; Groth, Burgess, and Holmstrom 1977; Guttmacher and Weihofen 1952; Podolsky 1966; Prentky, Burgess, and Carter 1986; Rada 1978; Ressler 1985; and Scully and Marolla 1985). Podolsky notes that rapists who murder kill after raping their victims, primarily to escape detection. These murderers, according to Rada, rarely report sexual satisfaction from their murders or perform postmortem sexual acts with their victims. In contrast, the sadistic murderer kills as part of a ritualized, sadistic fantasy (Groth, Burgess, and Holmstrom 1977). For this murderer, aggression and sexuality become fused into a single psychological experience -- sadism -- in ...</p></p><h2>Leviathan Wakes</h2><p>Humanity has colonized the planets - interstellar travel is still beyond our reach, but the solar system has become a dense network of colonies.

His prize-winning stories began to appear in 1953, and Revolutionary Road, his first novel, was nominated for the National Book Award in 1961. He died in 1992.Chapter OneBy the time he was twenty-three, Michael Davenport had learned to trust his own skepticism. He didn&#39;t have much patience with myths or legends of any kind, even those that took the form of general assumptions; what he wanted, always, was to get down to the real story.He had come of age as a waist-gunner on a B-17, toward the end of the war in Europe, and one of the things he&#39;d liked least about the Army Air Force was its public-relations program. Everybody thought the Air Force was the luckiest, happiest branch of the service--better fed and quartered and paid than any other, given more personal freedom, given good clothes to be worn in a &#34;casual&#34; style. Everybody understood, too, that the Air Force couldn&#39;t be bothered with the petty side of military discipline: Flying and daring and high comradeship were esteemed over any blind respect for rank; officers and enlisted men could pal around together, if they felt like it, and even the regulation Army salute became a curled-up, thrown-away little mockery of itself in their hands. Soldiers of the ground forces were said to refer to them, enviously, as fly-boys.And all that stuff was probably harmless enough; it wasn&#39;t worth getting into any arguments about; but Michael Davenport would always know that his own Air Force years had been humbling and tedious and bleak, that his times in combat had come close to scaring the life out of him, and that he&#39;d been enormously glad to get out of the whole lousy business when it was over.Still, he did bring home a few good memories. One was that he had lasted through the semifinals as a middieweight in the boxing tournament at Blanchard Field, Texas--not many other lawyers&#39; sons from Morristown, New Jersey, could claim a thing like that. Another, which came to take on philosophical proportions the more he thought about it, was a remark made one sweltering afternoon by some nameless Blanchard Field gunnery instructor in the course of an otherwise boring lecture.&#34;Try to remember this, men. The mark of a professional in any line of work--I mean any line of work--is that he can make difficult things look easy.&#34;And even then, brought awake among the sleepy trainees by that piercing idea, Michael had known for some time what line of work it was that he wanted eventually to make his mark in as a professional: he wanted to write poems and plays.As soon as the Army set him free he went to Harvard, mostly because that was where his father had urged him to apply, and at first he was determined not to be taken in by any of the myths or legends of Harvard, either: he didn&#39;t even care to acknowledge, let alone to admire, the physical beauty of the place. It was &#34;school,&#34; a school like any other, and as grimly eager as any other to collect its share of his GI Bill of Rights money.But after a year or two he began to relent a little. Most of the courses were stimulating; most of the books were the kind he had always wanted to read; the other students, some of them, anyway, were turning out to be the kind of men he had always craved as companions. He never wore any of his old Army clothes--the campus was crawling then with men who did, and who were largely dismissed as &#34;professional veterans&#34;--but he kept the modified handlebar mustache that had been his only affectation in the service, because it still served the purpose of making him look older than his years. And he had to admit, now and then, that he didn&#39;t really mind the light that came into people&#39;s eyes, or the quickening of their attention, when they learned he had been an aerial gunner--or that his playing it down seemed only to make it all the more impressive. He was prepared to believe that Harvard might, after all, provide a good-enough environment for learning how to make difficult things look easy.Then one spring afternoon in his junior year--all bitterness gone, all cynicism drowned--he wholly succumbed to the myth and the legend of the lovely Radcliffe girl who could come along at any moment and change your life.&#34;You know so much,&#34; she told him, reaching across a restaurant table to grasp one of his hands with both of her own. &#34;I don&#39;t know any other way to put it. You just--know so much.&#34;The Radcliffe girl&#39;s name was Lucy Blaine. She had been chosen for the leading role in Michael&#39;s first halfway decent one-act play, which was then in rehearsal at a small campus theater, and this was the first time he had worked up the courage to ask her out.&#34;Every word,&#34; she was saying, &#34;every sound and silence in this play is the work of a man with a profound understanding of the--you know--of the human heart. Oh, God, now I&#39;ve embarrassed you.&#34;That was true--he was too embarrassed to meet her eyes--and he could only hope it wouldn&#39;t make her want to change the subject. She wasn&#39;t the prettiest girl he had ever met, but she was the first pretty girl who had ever shown so much interest in him, and he knew he could get a lot of mileage out of a mixture like that.When it seemed appropriate to offer a compliment or two of his own he told her how much he&#39;d enjoyed her performance at the rehearsals.&#34;Oh, no,&#34; she said quickly, and for the first time he noticed she&#39;d been tearing her paper napkin into careful, resolutely parallel strips on the table. &#34;I mean, thanks, and of course that&#39;s nice to hear, but I know I&#39;m not really an actress. If I were I&#39;d have gone to acting school somewhere, and I&#39;d be knocking myself out in summer stock and trying to get auditions and all that. No&#34;--she gathered all the strips of napkin into her fist and gently thumped the table with it for emphasis--&#34;no, it&#39;s just something I like to do, the way little girls play dress-up in their mothers&#39; clothes. And the point is I could never&#39;ve dreamed--could never&#39;ve dreamed I&#39;d be working in a play like this.&#34;He had already discovered, in walking away from the theater with her, that she was exactly the right size for him--the top of her head floated just at the edge of his shoulder--and he knew she was the right age, too: she was twenty; he would soon be twenty-four. Now, as he took her back to the drab room on Ware Street where he lived alone in &#34;approved student housing,&#34; he wondered if this persistent just-rightness, this pattern of near-perfection, could possibly hold. Wouldn&#39;t there have to be a hitch in it somewhere?&#34;Well, it&#39;s about like what I imagined,&#34; she said when he&#39;d shown her into his place, while he made a quick furtive search of the room to be sure there were no dirty socks or underwear in sight. &#34;Sort of stark and simple and a good place to work. Oh, and it&#39;s so--masculine.&#34;The pattern of near-perfection held. When she turned away from him to look out a window--&#34;And I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s lovely and bright here in the mornings, isn&#39;t it? With these tall windows? And these trees?&#34;--it seemed entirely natural to move up close behind her, put his arms around her, and take both of her breasts in his hands while he sank his mouth into the side of her neck.In less than a minute they were naked and reveling under the Army blankets of his double bed, and Michael Davenport found he hadn&#39;t yet known such a fine and responsive girl, hadn&#39;t even guessed at what a boundless, extraordinary new world a girl could be.&#34;Oh, Jesus,&#34; he said when they were finally at peace, and he wanted to tell her something poetic but didn&#39;t know how. &#34;Oh, Jesus, you&#39;re nice, Lucy.&#34;&#34;Well, I&#39;m glad you think so,&#34; she said in a low, subtle voice, &#34;because I think you&#39;re wonderful.&#34;And it was springtime in Cambridge. Nothing else was of any consequence at all. Even the play had ceased to matter very much: when a Harvard Crimson reviewer called it &#34;sketchy&#34; and described Lucy&#39;s performance as &#34;tentative&#34; they were both able to take it in stride. There would be other plays soon enough; and besides, everybody knew what envious little snots the Crimson reviewers were.&#34;Can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve asked you this before,&#34; he said once when they were strolling in the Boston Common, &#34;but what does your father do?&#34;&#34;Oh, he sort of-- manages things. Different kinds of business things. I&#39;ve never quite known what he does, exactly.&#34;And that was the first clue he had, apart from her elegantly simple clothes and manners, that Lucy&#39;s family might be very rich.There were further clues a month or two later, when she took him home to meet her parents at their summer place on Martha&#39;s Vineyard. He had never seen anything like it. First you drove to an obscure coastal village called Woods Hole, where you went aboard a surprisingly luxurious ferryboat that floated you out over miles of sea; then, once ashore again on the distant island of &#34;the Vineyard,&#34; you followed a road between tall uncropped hedges until you came to an almost-hidden driveway that led around among lawns and trees and took you down near the edge of the gentle water, and there was the Blaines&#39; house--long and amply proportioned, made almost as much of glass as of wood, with its wooden sections finished in dark brown shingles that looked silver in the dappled sunlight.&#34;I was beginning to think we&#39;d never get to meet you, Michael,&#34; Lucy&#39;s father said after shaking hands with him. &#34;We&#39;ve heard almost nothing but your name since--well, I suppose it&#39;s only been since April or so, but it seems much longer.&#34;Mr. Blame and his wife were tall and lean and graceful, with faces as intelligent as their daughter&#39;s. They both had the kind of taut, tan skin that comes with easy mastery of swimming and tennis, and their husky voices suggested a full appreciation of daily alcohol. Neither of them looked more than forty-five years old. Seated and smiling together on a long chintz-covered sofa, in their impeccable summer clothes, they might have been a photograph illustrating a magazine article with a title like &#34;Is There an American Aristocracy?&#34;&#34;Lucy?&#34; Mrs. Blaine was saying. &#34;Do you think you&#39;ll be able to stay through Sunday? Or would that mean keeping you away from any number of romantic imperatives back in Cambridge?&#34;A soft-treading Negro maid came in with a liquor tray, and the early tension of their gathering began to fade. Sitting back to savor the first sip or two of an ice-cold, bone-dry martini, Michael stole an unbelieving glance at the girl of his dreams and then let his gaze follow the lofty ceiling line of one bright wall until it met at right angles with another, far away, that opened onto other and still other rooms in the shadows of the afternoon. This was a place suggesting the timeless repose that only several generations&#39; worth of success could provide. This was class.&#34;Well, but what do you mean, &#39;class&#39;?&#34; Lucy asked him, with an exasperated little puckering of her forehead, as they walked alone along the narrow beach the next day. &#34;When you use a word like that it makes you sound sort of proletarian and dumb, or something, and you must know I know better than that.&#34;&#34;Well, compared to you I am proletarian.&#34;&#34;Oh, that&#39;s silly,&#34; she said. &#34;That&#39;s the silliest thing I&#39;ve ever heard you say.&#34;&#34;Okay, but listen: Do you think we might get out of here tonight? Instead of staying through Sunday?&#34;&#34;Well, I suppose so, sure. But why?&#34;&#34;Because.&#34; And he stopped to let her turn toward him so that his fingers could touch one of her nipples, very tenderly, through the fabric of her shirt. &#34;Because there are any number of romantic imperatives back in Cambridge.&#34;His own most important romantic imperative, all through the fall and winter of that year, was to find attractive ways of fending off her shy but persistent wish to be married.&#34;Well, of course I want to,&#34; he would say. &#34;You know that. I want to as much as you do, or even more. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;d be too smart a thing to do before I&#39;ve even gotten started in any kind of work. Isn&#39;t that reasonable?&#34;And she would seem to agree, but he learned soon enough that words like &#34;reasonable&#34; didn&#39;t carry much weight with Lucy Blaine.A wedding date was set for the week after his graduation. His family came up from Morristown to smile in courteous bewilderment through the ceremony, and Michael found himself a married man without being fully aware of how it had all come about. When their taxicab brought them from the church to the reception, in an old stone building at the base of Beacon Hill, he and Lucy emerged under the looming figure of a mounted policeman who raised one hand to the visor of his cap in a formal salute as his beautifully groomed horse stood straight and still as a statue at the curbside.&#34;Jesus,&#34; Michael said as they started up an elegant flight of stairs. &#34;How much do you suppose it costs to hire a mounted cop for a wedding reception?&#34;&#34;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&#34; she said impatiently. &#34;Not much, I shouldn&#39;t think. Fifty?&#34;&#34;Gotta be a lot more than fifty, honey,&#34; he told her, &#34;if only because you&#39;d have to buy oats for the horse.&#34; And she laughed and hugged his arm to show she knew he was only fooling.A small orchestra played a medley of Cole Porter tunes in one of the three or four big, open rooms of the reception, and crouching bartenders raced under the pressure of their orders. Michael spotted his parents once in the sea of guests and was glad to find they had a sufficient number of strangers to talk to, and that their Morristown clothes looked all right, but then he lost sight of them again. A very old, wheezing man, wearing the silk rosette of some rare honor in the lapel of his custom-made suit, was trying to explain that he&#39;d known Lucy since she was a baby--in her pram! In her little woolly mittens and her booties!&#34;--and another man, much younger, with a knuckle-crushing handshake, wanted to know how Michael felt about sinking-fund debentures. There were three girls who had known Lucy &#34;at Farmington&#34; and who rushed with squeals of happiness to embrace her, though she could scarcely wait until they were gone to tell Michael that she hated them all, and there were women of her mother&#39;s age who dabbed at invisible tears in saying they had never seen such a lovely bride. It was while pretending to listen to the drink-fuddled talk of a man who played squash with Lucy&#39;s father that Michael thought again of the mounted policeman at the curb. Surely it wouldn&#39;t be possible to &#34;hire&#34; a cop and his horse; they could have been stationed here only through the courtesy of the police department, or of the mayor, and that suggested an element of &#34;influence&#34; in Lucy&#39;s family as well as of money.</p><h2>California Orange Box Labels: An Illustrated History</h2><p>In the seventy year period from the 1880s to the mid 1950s millions of colorful paper labels were used by California citrus growers to identify and advertise the wooden boxes of oranges the shipped throughout the United States.

But he also had a huge impact on his times as an icon of the evangelical movement, as a great preacher and theologian, and as a seminal influence on abolitionist William Wilberforce. Newton's friendship with Wilberforce is portrayed in the major motion picture <em>Amazing Grace</em>.</p> <p>Jonathan Aitken's new biography John Newton explores all these facets of Newton's life and character. It is the first biography to draw on Newton's unpublished diaries and correspondence, providing fresh insight into the life of this complex and memorable Christian. The result is a fascinating, colorful, and historically significant portrait of John Newton, a self-described "great sinner" redeemed by a great Savior through amazing grace.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jonathan Aitken</strong> is a well-known British author and former politician. He was a Member of Parliament for twenty-three years, serving in the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and also as Minister of State for Defense. His political career ended when he pleaded guilty to charges of perjury as a result of having told a lie on oath in a civil libel lawsuit. During an eighteen-month prison stay, he converted to Christ. He is president of Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a director of Prison Fellowship International, and executive director of The Trinity Forum in Europe. He is the author of twelve books, including the award-winning <em>Nixon: A Life</em> and <em>Charles W. Colson: A Life Redeemed</em>.</p>Jonathan Aitken gives an authentic picture of the life and times of John Newton, best known as the creator of the timeless hymn �Amazing Grace.� Newton was also a preacher, theologian, and serious influencer of abolitionist William Wilberforce, who instigated the successful campaign to ban the British slave trade. Aitken�s dynamic range and effortless narration capture Newton�s dramatic disregard for authority, including his escape attempt from the Navy, which demoted him to the lowest rank of seaman. His seamless narrative portrays Newton�s rise to captain of his own slave ship, on which he sailed the Ivory Coast, where he was taken captive himself and experienced terrible brutality at hands of another slave-trader, an experience that transformed him. Aitken delivers a credible biography, which includes a foreword by Philip Yancey.

Sent by an Italian paper during World War II to cover the fighting on the Eastern Front, Malaparte secretly wrote this terrifying report from the abyss, which became an international bestseller when it was published after the war. Telling of the siege of Leningrad, of glittering dinner parties with Nazi leaders, and of trains disgorging bodies in war-devastated Romania, Malaparte paints a picture of humanity at its most depraved.<br><br><i>Kaputt</i> is an insider's dispatch from the world of the enemy that is as hypnotically fascinating as it is disturbing.</p><p>Curzio Malaparte spent most of World War II as an Italian consul to other fascist states: Germany, Romania, Finland. His novelistic account of the war, surreptitiously written, presents the conflict from the point of view of those doomed to lose it. Malaparte&#39;s account is marked by sharp, lyrical observations, as when he encounters a detachment of German soldiers fleeing a Ukrainian battlefield: &#34;When Germans become afraid, when that mysterious German fear begins to creep into their bones, they always arouse a special horror and pity. Their appearance is miserable, their cruelty sad, their courage silent and hopeless.&#34; Bleak and hopeless indeed, Malaparte&#39;s is a remarkable testimonial."Kaputt is a sad, astonishing, horrifying and lyrical book. It shows us the results of ideological fanaticism, racism, twisted values masquerading as spiritual purity, and the hatred of life, in their most personal and shameful aspects. It is essential for any human understanding of World War II." &#x2014;Margaret Atwood</p><h2>Murder at the Manor: An Agatha Christie Lost Classics Omnibus</h2><p>This exclusive 2-in-1 large print edition contains both mind-bending bafflers that represent the inimitible Queen of Mystery at the top of her splendid game.

Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon (Lower Elements Police) needs the help of young mastermind Artemis Fowl to save both humans and fairies. But Artemis has been mind-wiped and has no recollection of his previous adventures with the LEP. Nathaniel Parker strides confidently into the worlds of fantasy and technology that unite humans and fairies. He unerringly re-creates the many voices from the first three installments, and his appropriately hurried pacing takes the listener from one breathless calamity to another. Parker's stereotyped Asian accent becomes a bit annoying, but this is a small complaint in an otherwise welcome revival of Colfer's panoply of characters.

Evolution, it seems, has not completely obliterated its tracks as more advanced organisms have evolved; the history of life on earth is far older&#x2014;and odder&#x2014;than many of us realize. <br> &nbsp;<br> Scattered across the globe, these remarkable plants and animals continue to mark seminal events in geological time. From a moonlit beach in Delaware, where the hardy horseshoe crab shuffles its way to a frenzy of mass mating just as it did 450 million years ago, to the dense rainforests of New Zealand, where the elusive, unprepossessing velvet worm has burrowed deep into rotting timber since before the breakup of the ancient supercontinent, to a stretch of Australian coastline with stromatolite formations that bear witness to the Precambrian dawn, the existence of these survivors offers us a tantalizing glimpse of pivotal points in evolutionary history. These are not &#x201c;living fossils&#x201d; but rather a handful of tenacious creatures of days long gone. <br> &nbsp;<br> Written in buoyant, sparkling prose, <i>Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms</i> is a marvelously captivating exploration of the world&#x2019;s old-timers combining the very best of science writing with an explorer&#x2019;s sense of adventure and wonder.</p><p>Richard Fortey was a senior paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London until his retirement in 2006.

There are, scat- tered over the globe, organisms and ecologies which still survive from earlier times. These speak to us of seminal events in the history of life. They range from humble algal mats to hardy musk oxen that linger on in the tundra as last vestiges of the Ice Age. The history of life can be approached through the fossil record; a narrative of forms that have vanished from the earth. But it can also be understood through its survivors, the animals and plants that time has left behind. My intention is to visit these organisms in the field, to take the reader on a journey to the exotic, or even everyday, places where they live. There will be landscapes to evoke, boulders to turn over, seas to pad- dle in. I shall describe the animals and plants in their natural habitats, and explain why they are important in understanding pivotal points in evolutionary history. So it will be a journey through time, as well as around the globe.<br><br>I have always thought of myself as a naturalist first, and a palaeon- tologist second, although I cannot deny that I have spent most of my life looking at thoroughly dead creatures. This book is something of a departure for me, with the focus switched to living organisms that help reveal the tree of life (see endpapers). I will frequently return to considering fossils to show how my chosen creatures root back into ancient times. I have also broken my usual rules of narrative. The logical place to start is at the beginning, which in this case would mean with the oldest and most primitive organisms. Or I could start with the present and work backwards, as in Richard Dawkins&#x2019; <i>The Ancestor&#x2019;s Tale</i>. Instead, I have opted to start somewhere in the mid- dle. This is not perversity on my part. It seemed appropriate to start my exploration in a place, biologically speaking, that is familiar to me. The ancient horseshoe crabs of Delaware Bay were somehow fit- ting, not least on account of their trilobite connections. Amid all the concern about climate change and extinction, it is encouraging to begin with an organism whose populations can still be counted in their millions. From this starting point somewhere inside the great and spreading tree of life I can climb upwards to higher twigs if I wish, or maybe even delve downwards to find the trunk.

Lyacos&#39;s characters are always at a distance from society as such, fugitives, like the narrator of Z213: Exit, outcasts in a dystopian hinterland like the characters in With the People from the Bridge, or marooned, like the protagonist of The First Death whose struggle for survival unfolds on a desert-like island.

With near-greats like Brooks Robinson and George Kell, underpublicized long-term players like Gene Woodling and journeyman athletes, Peary ( Cult Baseball Players ) captures the spirit of a thrilling era in the national pastime. It was the period of racial integration; players were virtual serfs and they expected to serve long apprenticeships in the minor leagues and often bounced back and forth between the majors and the minors. Especially interesting are the players' differing attitudes toward such controversial figures as Casey Stengel and Rogers Hornsby. And there are rousing tales of boozing, camaraderie and, above all, hard work.

Explored from varying points of view - the mother receiving the order to evacuate; the daughter on the long train journey; the son in the desert encampment; the family's return home; and the bitter release of their father after four years in captivity - it tells of an incarceration that will alter their lives for ever.</p><p>Based on a true story, Julie Otsuka's powerful, deeply humane novel tells of an unjustly forgotten episode in America's wartime history.</p><p>'Honest and gloriously written, will haunt you long after you've turned the final page.

She lives in New York City.</p></p><p>A precise, understated gem of a first novel, Julie Otsuka's <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> tells one Japanese American family's story of internment in a Utah enemy alien camp during World War II. We never learn the names of the young boy and girl who were forced to leave their Berkeley home in 1942 and spend over three years in a dusty, barren desert camp with their mother. Occasional, heavily censored letters arrive from their father, who had been taken from their house in his slippers by the FBI one night and was being held in New Mexico, his fate uncertain. But even after the war, when they have been reunited and are putting their stripped, vandalized house back together, the family can never regain its pre-war happiness. Broken by circumstance and prejudice, they will continue to pay, in large and small ways, for the shape of their eyes. <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> is written in deceptively tranquil prose, a distillation of injustice, anger, and poetry; a notable debut. <i>--Regina Marler</i>&#x201c;Exceptional. . . .

New York Times reporter and Chinese-American (or American-born Chinese). In her search, Jennifer 8 Lee traces the history of Chinese-American experience through the lens of the food. In a compelling blend of sociology and history, Jenny Lee exposes the indentured servitude Chinese restaurants expect from illegal immigrant chefs, investigates the relationship between Jews and Chinese food, and weaves a personal narrative about her own relationship with Chinese food. The Fortune Cookie Chronicles speaks to the immigrant experience as a whole, and the way it has shaped our country.</p><p>Jennifer 8 Lee, the daughter of Chinese immigrants and a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese herself, grew up eating her mother's authentic Chinese food in her family's New York City kitchen before graduating from Harvard in 1999 with a degree in Applied Mathematics and economics and studying at Beijing University. At the age of 24, she was hired by the New York Times, where she is a metro repoter and has written a variety of stories on culture, poverty, and technology.<br><br>Lee travels wide and digs deep to unearth the answers to several burning questions...<br> From all-you-can-eat buffets in Kansas to the small southern Chinese village of Jietoupu, where she tracks down descendants of General Tso (who, natch, have never heard of, seen or tasted their forefather's infamous chicken dish), the author takes readers by the hand and brings them on her adventure.<br> (<b>The Washington Post</b> <i><b>Christine Y. Chen</b></i>)<br><br><i>"[Lee] embeds her subject's history in <b>an entertaining personal narrative, eschewing cookie-cutter interviews and dry lists of facts and figures</b> . . . <b>she has a breezy, likable literary demeanor that makes the first-person material engaging. Thanks to Lee's journalistic chops, the text moves along energetically even in its more expository sections . . . Tasty morsels delivered quickly and reliably</b>."</i> (<b>Kirkus Reviews</b>)<br><br>"<strong>Those of us who eat Chinese food are lucky to have Jennifer Lee as a guide to the modern global migrations and individual ingenuity that have made it the world's favorite cuisine.</strong> In <em>The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, </em>she offers many expertly told stories in one: a footloose and witty travelogue, a fascinating piece of historical reportage, and a quiet but moving memoir of the immigrant experience. Lee pursues her parallel investigations with a hearty appetite for economic curiosities, little patience for myth, and above all an empathy for the people who make, prepare, and deliver the food we eat." (<b>Sasha Issenberg, author of THE SUSHI ECONOMY</b>)<br><br>"Jennifer 8. Lee has cracked the world of Chinese restaurants like a fortune cookie. Her book is <strong>an addictive dim-sum of fact, fun, quirkiness and pathos. It's Anthony Bourdain meets Calvin Trillin. Lee is the kind of reporter I can only dream of being</strong>: committed, compassionate, resourceful, and savvy. I devoured this book in two nights (in bed), and suggest you do the same." (<b>Mary Roach, author of STIFF and SPOOK</b>)<br><br><strong>"Readers will take an unexpected and entertaining journey-through culinary, social and cultural history-in this delightful first book on the origins of the customary after-Chinese-dinner treat by <em>New York Times</em> reporter Lee</strong>. When a large number of Powerball winners in a 2005 drawing revealed that mass-printed paper fortunes were to blame, the author (whose middle initial is Chinese for "prosperity") went in search of the backstory. She tracked the winners down to Chinese restaurants all over America, and the paper slips the fortunes are written on back to a Brooklyn company. This travellike narrative serves as the spine of her cultural history-not a book on Chinese cuisine, but the Chinese food of take-out-and-delivery-and permits her to frequently but safely wander off into various tangents related to the cookie. There are satisfying minihistories on the relationship between Jews and Chinese food and a biography of the real General Tso, but <strong>Lee also pries open factoids and tidbits of American culture that eventually touch on large social and cultural subjects such as identity, immigration and nutrition. Copious research backs her many lively anecdotes, and being American-born Chinese yet willing to scrutinize herself as much as her objectives, she wins the reader over. Like the numbers on those lottery fortunes, the book's a winner."</strong> (<b>Publisher's Weekly, Starred Review</b>)</p><h2>Disappearing Nightly</h2><p>Esther Diamond, a struggling actress in New York, seems destined to attract supernatural mayhem.<br><br>When bizarre magical disappearances disrupt shows around the city, Esther receives a mysterious warning not to go on with her off-Broadway show.

Determined to get to the bottom of this mystery without losing her job, Esther and Max team up with a conjuring cowboy, a banker with stage aspirations, and a flock of fearless drag queens.

Minutes later, she met her tiny baby who clung to life support inside a glass box. Fei was forced to confront terrifying issues: How to be the mother of a child she could lose at any moment.

Born in Medford, MA, her grandfather&#39;s house still stands near the Mystic River as a tangible reminder of her most memorable poem.PreS - Grade 2-- This attractive new presentation of Child's 1844 poem,"A Boy's Thanksgiving Day," offers 13 full-page watercolors done in a detailed and delicately primitive style. As befits this style, the figures are somewhat stiff, and the overall effect is static. The colors are pleasingly light and clear. The childlike illustrations are in keeping with the unsophisticated nature of the rhyming text. Unlike the version illustrated with lively energy by Brinton Turkle (Coward, 1974), only 6 of the 12 verses are included, a streamlining that modern preschool and primary-grade teachers may well appreciate. The text is placed unobtrusively in the sky or on the snow-covered ground, and probably sings better than it reads. A piano arrangement of the familiar melody, a traditional French folk tune, is placed after the text. Child's time-honored poem successfully evokes the happy mood of a traditional and idealized family holiday gathering. --Cynthia Bishop, Onondaga County Public Library, Syracuse, NY<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gulliver&#39;s Fugitives (Star Trek: The Next Generation, No. 11)</h2><p>On the planet Rampart, a forgotten colony of humans fights against the Rampart government, which has outlawed fiction and imagination, and Captain Picard and his crew are caught in the middle of the unrest</p><p>While searching for the <i>U.S.S. Huxley</i>, missing for more than 10 years, the <i>Enterprise</i>TM stumbles across a forgotten colony of humans on a planet called Rampart, where fiction and works of the imagination of any kind are considered a heinous crime. A survey team beams aboard the ship to search for "contraband," and the crew are drawn immediately into a vicious civil war between Rampart's mind police and a band of determined rebels.</p><h2>The Beat Hotel: Ginsberg, Burroughs, and Corso in Paris, 1958-1963</h2><p>Vividly recreates the period from 1957 to 1963, when Paris&#39;s Beat Hotel, a cheap rooming house on the bohemian Left Bank, became the home and gathering place of Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Peter Orlovsky, Harold Norse, and other luminaries of the Beat Generation. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Miles (Jack Kerouac: King of the Beats, etc.), who has been intimately involved in the documentation of the Beat scene, focuses here on an international aspect of Beat work: Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso's escape from "the conformism and Puritanism of fifties America" during the six years (1957-1963) they lived at a cheap hotel on Paris's Left Bank. During this period, the three pursued such now-famous creative endeavors as "Kaddish," Naked Lunch and "Bomb." Their important work during this time, particularly the "cut-up" method pioneered by Burroughs, had an important formative influence on the next generation of artists, according to Miles. Part scholarly study and part gossip-fest, this account traces the aesthetic, sexual and social goings-on in Paris: "Within the shelter of the Beat Hotel," Miles writes, "they had mapped out many of the paths that the 'sixties generation' was to actually follow: the recreational use of drugs and experiments with psychedelics..., investigations into magic and mysticism..., gay rights and sexual freedom , the legalization of 'pornography' and challenges to obscenity laws." The hotel on rue Git-le-Coeur, closed for nearly four decades now, still symbolizes the fruitful ground of collaborative creation among the Beats. The significance of this period in Paris for the Beats may be slightly exaggerated by Miles to justify this book-length study, but those interested in the lives of these cult figures will most likely forgive such overdetermination in the interests of learning in an entertaining narrative about important writers now considered American literary heroes. (July) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.The cheap rooming house at nine rue Git-Le-Coeur became known as the Beat Hotel after several Beat writers made it their home in Paris. In this interesting blend of sexual gossip and literary scholarship, Miles, author of full-length biographies of Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Jack Kerouac, paints a vivid picture of literary life along the Left Bank in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He recounts not only the Beat writers' creative interactions with one other but their relations with such Frenchmen as Maurice Girodias, publisher of the Olympia Press, and Henri Michaux, an author who shared their fascination with the use of drugs to heighten consciousness. Miles also documents the influences of a number of European writers on the Beats, including Andr Breton, Louis-Ferdinand C line, and Sergei Esenin. Finally, he is particularly good at exploring the collaboration between Brion Gysin and Burroughs that led to their famous cut-up method. This is fun reading, especially for those steeped in the Beats. Recommended for academic and larger public libraries.<br><i>-DWilliam Gargan, Brooklyn Coll.

But the left and right can usually agree on one thing: that the Nordic system is impossible to replicate elsewhere. The US and UK are too big, or too individualistic, or too . . . something. <br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Viking Economics</i>&#x2014;perhaps the most fun economics book you&#x2019;ve ever read&#x2014;George Lakey dispels these myths. He explores the inner-workings of the Nordic economies that boast the world&#x2019;s happiest, most productive workers, and explains how, if we can enact some of the changes the Scandinavians fought for surprisingly recently, we, too, can embrace equality in our economic policy.</p><p><b>GEORGE LAKEY </b>is Visiting Professor at Swarthmore College. He is the author of many books and articles and has written for <i>Waging Nonviolence</i> and <i>Common Dreams,</i> among other publications.&#x201c;Here, Lakey combines historical analysis, economic data and interview-based opinion to produce something that delivers much more than each of those could do in isolation. As a result, <i>Viking Economics</i> tells a story of economic change and the foundations on which it was built at a time when it is so obvious that such narratives are desperately needed in modern political discourse.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Richard Murphy, <i>Times Higher Education</i> magazine&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Viking Economics </i>shows us there's no reason we couldn't be making far more progress across a wide range of problems.

Prompted perhaps by the recent acquisition of the newly discovered Macclesfield Psalter, the University has assembled the best of its manuscripts and those of its colleges in a double exhibition, partly in the Fitzwilliam Museum and partly in the University Library. There, in suitably subdued lighting, the Illuminations of the Middle Ages shine brightly forth - the skilful handiwork of master craftsmen-artists spanning a thousand years. The manuscripts range from the Gospels that Augustine brought with him to Canterbury at the end of the sixth century to the letters patent, writs and charters issued to the University and its Colleges by the later Medieval and Tudor monarchs. It is a breathtaking collection. The manuscripts and the catalogue are cleverly arranged thematically according to their contents and function: The Coming of Christianity, The Bible and its Study, Liturgy and the Offices, Private Devotion, Humanistic manuscripts, and so on, and chronologically within each section. What do I mention next? Will my favourites be yours? The vivid coloured drawings in the Eadwine Psalter, the intense blues and greens of the Bury Bible, countless lively and intricate miniatures in Books of Hours and Psalters, many with floriated backgrounds to inspire William Morris, or Athelstan presenting a book to Saint Cuthbert; and there are musical and scientific and zoological illuminations; and a fine picture of Tully; and, of course, the Macclesfield Psalter itself. The Macclesfield Psalter is Cambridge&#39;s latest spectacular acquisition; and it has a room to itself. Described as &#34;the most important medieval illuminated manuscript found in Britain in living memory&#34; it was written and illuminated in East Anglia about 1330. Its illumination is a combination of refined beauty and ribald humour, all depicted in glowing gold and rare pigments. The Psalter has been taken apart which allows the leaves to be displayed separately, and a large number of illuminations to be viewed in the exhibition hence the gallery to itself. It is a once-in-lifetime opportunity to see so much of this spectacular manuscript at one time. This catalogue is filled with authoritative descriptions by Paul Binski, Rosamund McKitterick, Teresa Webber, Nigel Morgan, Jonathan Alexander, Christopher de Hamel, Nicolas Rogers and Stella Panayotova.</p><p></p><h2>Heather&#39;s Gift (Men of August, Book 3)</h2><p>Book 3 in the Men Of August series Will she bring the gift of acceptance, or will she break the bonds that have been forged through the fires of hell?

In the throes of this misguided compassion she first murders her own granddaughter and afterwards finds herself set on a course she is unable to stop despite the promptings of her conscience and her awareness of the consequences. Papadiamandis charts this course and the events in her life that preceded it, and against a background of the island&#39;s verdant and untrodden places and the living presence of the Church he explores the particular quality evil has of disguising itself as good, but without ever passing judgement on the murderess herself. Long considered one of Greece&#39;s most important writers, Papadiamandis&#39;s reflections on and observations of modern Greek life define the Greek experience in a way unmatched by any of his contemporaries. This new translation of &#34;The Murderess&#34; has been undertaken and published to mark the centenary of Papadiamandis&#39;s death.</p><p></p><h2>The Trouble With Women</h2><p><b>CAN WOMEN BE GENIUSES?

Grades 3-6. --Erin Anderson</p><h2>Blue Skies and Blood: The Battle of the Coral Sea</h2><p>The first definitive account of one of the most critical naval battles of World War II in the pacific. Spring 1942: Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, America was reeling under the successive Japanese victories at Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines and more. Desperate to stop what was seen as an inexorable Japanese advance toward Australia, the weak U.S. Navy intercepted the large Japanese fleet in the Coral Sea. The Battle of the Coral Sea ushered a new era in sea warfare. For the first time ever opposing fleets used carrier-launched aircraft to fight each other. It was a fight that would determine the future of the war. Few writers can sustain the kind of exciting narrative that distinguishes this account of brave men fighting each other to the death. Edwin P.Hoyt is one such writer. In BLUE SKIES AND BLOOD you hear the frightening roar of the dive-bombers&#39; engines, feel the concussions of explosions that ripped apart the mighty aircraft carriers from stem to stern, and smell the acrid odor of cordite and terror as tonnes of sea water rush into ruptured smoke-filled hulls.

His work has appeared in the Denver Post, Collier&#39;s, American Heritage, and CBS News.</p><h2>The Cadence of Grass</h2><p>In his first novel since his best-selling <i>Nothing but Blue Skies</i>, and thirty-three years after <i>The Sporting Club</i> established his reputation, Thomas McGuane&#x2019;s trademark combination of high wit, low behavior, and hard-won wisdom has never been on sharper&#x2014;or, ultimately, more moving&#x2014;display. This is the story of the Whitelaws, a family whose values are as far-flung as the territory they helped settle, and whose most recent generations have pioneered the landscape of dysfunction.<br><br>The patriarch, Sunny Jim, exerts his perverse control even posthumously, by means of a last will and testament that binds the family fortune (a bottling franchise) to a marriage that ought, by general assent, to be rent asunder. The charms of this particular son-in-law, lately released from prison, are potent if short-lived; Evelyn Whitelaw, his estranged wife, is quite literally bedeviled by them. And as her mother and sister court this twisted inheritance, her own yearnings point toward a way of life once habitual on these western plains but now embodied only by Bill Champion, the family&#x2019;s ranch foreman and Evelyn&#x2019;s one true compass.<br><br>A novel charged with the relentless and often contradictory claims of blood, money, history, and love, <i>The Cadence of Grass</i> is at once a masterpiece of savage comedy and an elegy for what has been lost. Long one of our most compelling novelists, Thomas McGuane has written the most ambitious book of his singularly distinguished career.</p><p>Thomas McGuane's <i>The Cadence of Grass</i> is a brawling, barrel-chested novel full of irreverent humor and outrageous characters and situations. Set in Montana, the story begins with the funeral of Jim Whitelaw, the family patriarch, who has cunningly crafted a will that ties up the assets of his bottling company until his older daughter reconciles with her estranged rogue of a husband. With Jim's ditzy yet determined widow; his wild younger daughter and her sweet but unbalanced husband; a cross-dressing rancher; a missing kidney; and a mysterious Bengali, it all adds up to a wild ride. But it's Bill Champion, Jim Whitelaw's old ranching partner, who wins our hearts. A throwback to the old days, Bill is full of Western wisdom and pungent sayings--he defines a "coyote breakfast" as "a piss and a look around." Eventually, Bill reveals a surprising secret as well as the identity of Red Wolf. Like his previous novels, including <i>Nothing but Blue Skies</i>, <i>Panama</i>, <i>Ninety-Two in the Shade</i>, and <i>The Bushwhacked Piano</i>, McGuane's <i>The Cadence of Grass</i> is a ripsnorting read indeed. <i>--Susan Biskeborn</i>&#x201c;[D]arkly fiendish, wildly unsettling, and viciously good.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;Men&#x2019;s Journal</i> <br><br>&#x201c;A hearty welcome home. . .a tale of betrayal, revenge and spousal loathing. . .[that] rollicks along on the legs of its comic characters.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>Outside</i><br><br> &#x201c;Beautifully turned....a surprising, affecting mix of bitterness and delicacy.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;Entertainment Weekly</i><br> <br>&#x201c;McGuane&#x2019;s sentences are like no one else&#x2019;s, crisp and spare, yet somehow baroque, and he perpetually balances the picaresque against the sublime.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker<br><br></i>&#x201c;McGuane has struck a perfect balance. . .between his large cast of beautifully drawn and memorable characters and the animals they raise and work and love.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;</i>Alan Cheuse<i>, Chicago Tribune<br><br></i>&#x201c;A fine, quirky, funny, startling novel . . . with witty dialogue and hilarious moments and sudden violence and awful betrayals.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Miami Herald<br><br></i>&#x201c;McGuane is a terrific writer, a great chronicler of the vanishing West.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Orlando Sentinel<br></i> <br>&#x201c;There is a raw exuberance to this hard-edged novel. . . .

Gazzaniga, a former student and colleague of Nobel Laureate Roger Sperry, was a pioneer in studies of the separate hemispheres of the brain. The brain, he concludes in the course of debunking many of the misinterpretations of the right-brain/left-brain studies of the past 20 years, is made up of independently acting modules that, almost in a social way, interact to bring about mental and physical behavior. Extrapolating from findings in brain-damaged and "split-brain" patients, he discusses how the left brain's "need to interpret" may be applied to explaining such topics as prejudice, evolution, and religion. A fascinating excursion into the "higher" reaches of mind-brain by a witty and clear-thinking neuroscientist. Highly recommended for general and university collections.

The author of a number of books for adults, she lives in Rochester, Minnesota.Writing in the third person, Schaeffer recalls, and perhaps embroiders, incidents from her early childhood in China, and her move to the US in 1920. The daughter of American teachers, little Mei Fuh knows a world bounded by the walls of the European compound in Wenchow (now Wengzhou), although her Chinese amah (nanny) and the gatekeeper, Adjipah, occasionally allow her a glimpse outside. Realistically for a five-year-old, playtime, exotic sights, and childhood traumas blend together, so that the pleasure of watching her goldfish is only briefly dimmed by its sudden loss (while the child was away, Adjipah cooked and ate the fish), and the agony of spilling boiling water on her legs is forgotten in the joy of caring for a box of silkworms, then wearing the resultant dress. On the other hand, some of the amah's casual comments, e.g., about ``newborn baby girls that have been thrown away,'' however true to their time, will be invidious to many readers; the episodic nature of Mei Fuh's experiences makes for a disjointed narrative, although there is compensation in some of the charmingly childlike details Schaeffer provides (treating them as fiction, and without noting where truth and invention diverge). The cheerful, expressively posed figures in Liu's delicate black-and-white pen drawings evoke an innocent exuberance that will draw both adults and children to this volume, but they may find a more sensitive view of a similar childhood in Jean Fritz's Homesick (1982).

Dr. Weigle, who teaches at the University of New Mexico, is a noted authority on the Penitente Brotherhood. Etchings by Eli Levin.</p><p>NONEIntroduction The Penitente Brotherhood is a lay religious organization related to the Roman Catholic Church in the southwestern United States, primarily northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Penitentes, commonly known as Los Hermanos Penitentes (The Penitent Brothers) or simply Los Hermanos (The Brothers), are almost exclusively men of Hispanic descent and Catholic faith. In time, localized associations of these men - originally organized for pious observances involving the expiation of sin through prayer and bodily penance, and for mutual aid - acquired judical and political influence.</p><h2>Mote in Gods Eye</h2><p>Aliens - Moties - were first contacted in AD3017 in the region of space known as the Coalsack. The eponymous mote in his eye, which has winked out, much to the distress of pious Himmists, just might have been Motie laser light. It might even indicate the position of their home planet.</p><p>In the year 3016, the Second Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to the faster-than-light Alderson Drive. No other intelligent beings have ever been encountered, not until a light sail probe enters a human system carrying a dead alien. The probe is traced to the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud, and an expedition is dispatched.<p> In the Mote the humans find an ancient civilization--at least one million years old--that has always been bottled up in their cloistered solar system for lack of a star drive. The Moties are welcoming and kind, yet rather evasive about certain aspects of their society. It seems the Moties have a dark problem, one they've been unable to solve in over a million years.</p><p> This is the first collaboration between Niven and Pournelle, two masters of hard science fiction, and it combines Pournelle's interest in the military and sociology with Niven's talent for creating interesting, believable aliens. The novel meticulously examines every aspect of First Contact, from the Moties' biology, society, and art, to the effects of the meeting on humanity's economics, politics, and religions. And all the while suspense builds as we watch the humans struggle toward the truth. <i>--Brooks Peck</i></p>Writing separately, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle are responsible for a number of science fiction classics, such as the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning <i>Ringworld, Debt of Honor,</i>and <i>The Integral Trees.</i> Together they have written the critically acclaimed bestsellers <i>Inferno, Footfall,</i> and <i>The Legacy of Heorot,</i>among others. <i>The Mote In God's Eye </i>is their acknowledged masterpiece, an epic novel of mankind's first encounter with alien life that transcends the genre.</p><h2>Simply Canning: Survival Guide to Safe Home Canning</h2><p>Do you know the most important information for safely home canning?

But as high school graduation nears, so does an uncomfortable realization: pleasing her parents once overlapped with pleasing herself, but now . . . not so much. Wren needs to honor her own desires, but how can she if she doesn&#x2019;t even know what they are?Charlie Parker, on the other hand, is painfully aware of his heart&#x2019;s desire. A gentle boy with a troubled past, Charlie has loved Wren since the day he first saw her. But a girl like Wren would never fall for a guy like Charlie&#x2014;at least not the sort of guy Charlie believes himself to be.And yet certain things are written in the stars. And in the summer after high school, Wren&#x2019;s and Charlie&#x2019;s souls will collide.

She lives with her family in Fort Collins, Colorado. Visit her online at laurenmyracle.com.Gr 10 Up-Wren Gray has spent her first 18 years pleasing her parents, earning perfect grades and early acceptance into the school and program her dad was hoping for, and, of course, keeping clear of boyfriends. Charlie Parker has spent his first 18 years navigating through foster homes and maintaing his position under the radar. He has loved Wren since the first time he saw her. When chance brings them together for their first conversation, it's electric, and they both know that neither one of them will ever be the same. Wren just might have the courage to look for what she wants out of life-and Charlie just might finally know what true love is. This charming romance has multidimensional characters, straightforward sexuality, and a pace that lets readers fall in love with the main characters. Myracle expertly captures the intense connection of first love, from the need to spend every moment together to trying to figure out how to communicate with one another. The abrupt ending feels out of sync with the rest of the book, but readers should be pleased with it nonetheless. Myracle does not remove the physical aspects of two teens in love, bringing to mind Judy Blume's Forever.

He had been in ministry for 30 years, and 10 years after founding what is now the largest church in Hawaii, he found himself depleted. Wayne took a season out of his growing ministry to recharge and refocus on the truly important. He was able to get back in touch with his life, get back in proper balance, and re-energize his spirit through Christ in a way that propelled him forward to greater levels of service. Wayne first gave this message at a recent Willow Creek Leadership Summit, where it was the highest-rated presentation by those in attendance. Pulling no punches, Wayne talks about the walls leaders must break through and how to move on with integrity. Included are ways to care for oneself physically and emotionally as well as spiritually.</p><p>Don&#39;t Let Burnout Get the Best of You &#34;This is a must-read for all leaders. God often calls us to lead smarter, not harder, for the sake of His kingdom. We can all learn from a veteran leader like Wayne Cordeiro as he shares his decades of experience in this book.&#34; --Bill Hybels Senior Pastor, Willow Creek Community Church Chairman of the Board, Willow Creek Association &#34;Having experienced burnout personally earlier in my career I can attest to all Wayne has written, and especially to the fact that out of such a fire can come spiritual growth and maturity. I particularly want to encourage young pastors and Christian leaders who are just starting out in their ministries to devour this book and follow its wise counsel.&#34; --Archibald D. Hart, Ph.D., FPPR. Senior Professor of Psychology and Dean Emeritus, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary &#34;Sooner or later, we all find ourselves trying to lead on empty. It&#39;s a tough place to be. But the wisdom, transparency, and godly advice Wayne offers in these pages can spare us the grief. He shows how to keep the tank from running dry--or how to refill it if it&#39;s gone empty. If you&#39;re in ministry, you need to read this book.&#34; --Larry Osborne Senior Pastor, North Coast Church, Vista CA &#34;I strongly recommend Leading on Empty to any church planter, seasoned minister, or emerging leader. This book will help protect your flame and passion for ministry until we all reach our God-intended purpose and destiny.&#34; --Talo Sataraka Senior Pastor, New Hope Tokyo Director, New Hope Japan and Asia AssociationAre You Leading on Empty? It was a balmy California evening. I had gone for a jog before I was to speak at a leadership conference. I still can&#39;t recall how I got there, but I found myself sitting on a curb weeping uncontrollably. I couldn&#39;t tell if it took place suddenly or gradually, but I knew something had broken inside. I remember lifting my trembling hands and asking out loud, &#34;What in the world is happening to me?&#34; I had been leading on empty. That incident began a three-year odyssey I could never have imagined. It was a journey through a season of burnout and re-calibration that would radically change my lifestyle, my values, my goals, and even adjust my calling. Are you leading on empty? If you&#39;re a church or ministry leader, you probably identify with Wayne Cordeiro&#39;s experience of being overwhelmed by the demands of ministry. At times you may find yourself depleted of energy and longing to escape the constant pressure. In Leading on Empty, Wayne Cordeiro candidly shares his experience with the hope that it will encourage others headed down the same path. He was able to get back in touch with his life, get back in proper balance, and allow God to reenergize his spirit in a way that propelled him forward to greater levels of service. Learn from his experience how you can continue a fruitful ministry. Better yet, take advantage of Wayne&#39;s helpful advice early on and avoid burnout altogether.</p><h2>Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course: Lesson Book Level Two (Book &amp; Audio CD)</h2><p>This book begins with an extensive review of the chords and keys previously studied, using fresh and interesting material that will provide enjoyment as well as reinforcement.

The book brings into sharp focus the conditioned behavior and self-deception that are common in Western minds. </p><p>Far more than a literary tool for breaking loose old mental habits, it is a blueprint for a process of self-development that precludes self-deceit. Truly a book among books, A Perfumed Scorpion is treasured the world over for its clarity of wisdom and its forcefulness of insight.</p></p><p>As the urgency of our global situation becomes apparent, more and more readers are turning to the books of Idries Shah (1924-1996) as a way to train new capacities and new ways of thinking. Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." <p>Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. </p><p>Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. </p><p>Shah's landmark book, "The Sufis", invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. </p><p>University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah's books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. </p><p>In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography's Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who's Who in Poetry's Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). </p><p>According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph "it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable". </p><p>He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age. </p><p>"The most interesting books in the English language." Saturday Review </p><p>"A major psychological and cultural event of our time." Psychology Today </p><p>"One is immediately forced to use one's mind in a new way." New York Times </p><p>The instrumental function of Shah's work is now well established among people from all walks of life. Stockbrokers, scientists, lawyers, managers, writers, physicians, and diplomats have found Shah's literature for human development "extraordinary". </p><p>"It presents a blueprint of the human mental structure." Robert Ornstein, Ph.D. </p><p>"Extremely useful in teaching students about management and computers." Thomas Malone, MIT </p><p>"Idries Shah provides the unique perspective that allows us to assess real motivations and social biases in a more accurate light." E. Neilsen, Attorney at Law</p>BEARD, CLOAK AND ROSARY <p>I cannot resist, thinking of ancient formulae, referring to the story of the man with a bushy beard, wearing a rosary around his neck, dressed in a hooded cloak, with long and greasy hair, who was anxious, recently, to tell everyone that he was 'A Sufi.' </p><p>Someone - who really was a Sufi - asked him why he was behaving like that. He said: "I am following the instructions and information contained in this ancient handbook for disciples". </p><p>"But," said the real Sufi, "that cannot apply now - it was written several centuries ago..." </p><p>"That may well be" said the new 'Sufi', "but I only found it last month!"</p></p><h2>Understanding the Purpose and Power of Prayer: How to Call Heaven to Earth</h2><p><b>Learn to Pray&#x2014;</b><b>And Change the World // </b><br> "You're in Our Prayers" has become a cliche.

Perfect for gifting as well as for keeps. A prized edition for any library. When Elizabeth Bennet meets Fitzwilliam Darcy for the first time at a ball, she writes him off as an arrogant and obnoxious man. He not only acts like an insufferable snob, but she also overhears him rejecting the very idea of asking her for a dance! As life pits them against each other again and again, Darcy begins to fall for Elizabeth&#39;s wit and intelligence and Elizabeth begins to question her feelings about Darcy. But when Darcy saves her youngest sister Lydia from a scandal, Elizabeth starts to wonder if her pride has prejudiced her opinion of Darcy. Through this tale about two warring hearts, Jane Austen weaves a witty satire about life in eighteenth century England. And though it was published more than two centuries ago, Pride and Prejudice continues to enthrall readers to this very day. A beautiful classic leather-bound edition, this book is perfect as keepsake.</p><p>Jane Austen is one of the most well-known and widely-read English novelists of all time. She was born on December 16, 1775, at the rectory in the village of Steventon, in Hampshire, England. Jane s fascination with words and with the world of stories, began quite early. In the 1790s, during her adolescence, she started writing her own novels, the first one being Love and Freindship [sic] a parody of romantic fiction organized as a series of love letters. Between 1811 and 1816, Jane started to anonymously publish her works. Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park and Emma were all published during this time. Jane started working on Persuasion, her last completed novel, soon after she finished Emma. Written in her unique and distinctive style, it subtly exposes the rapidly changing and expanding social environment of the nineteenth century England. Completed in 1816, it was published posthumously in December 1817. In 1816, at the age of forty-one, Jane became ill with Addison s disease. She died on July 18, 1817.</p><h2>How Do Dinosaurs Say Merry Christmas?</h2><p><b>Ho ho ho!

During the toddler years, daily routines and transitions&#x2014;bedtime, naptime, clean-up time, and so on&#x2014;are big challenges, and every little success matters. The books are meant to take children and parents through familiar routines in a gentle, positive way. The simple language and colorful illustrations show toddlers learning new skills and celebrating success. Parents and caregivers can use the tips at the end to take the ideas further and personalize their routines.<br><br> A note from the illustrator, Marieka Heinlen:<br><br> As an illustrator, I always have two objectives. The first is to create artwork that truly engages young children. I try to see the world through their eyes, brimming with color and positivity. I keep my images bright, bold, and simple with fun details. Many people tell me kids like finding a paw waving among hands or a doll changing expression, little jokes just for them. The other goal is to try new mediums. I started with pencils and paints, moved into creating art electronically, and am currently playing with fabrics and collage. A lot of the vintage fabrics reminded me of my own childhood&#x2014;other readers may get that warm, fuzzy feeling from them as well. Making art for children is a joy, and using it to teach them is a privilege.<br></p><h2>Have You Thanked an Inventor Today?</h2><p><p><strong>Have You Thanked an Inventor Today?</strong> is a journey into the often forgotten contributions of African-American inventors, that contributed to the American landscape.

She currently resides in Lawrenceville, GA with her husband and two children.<p>Reviewed by Vernita Naylor for Readers' Favorite</p><p>Have You Thanked an Inventor Today? by Patrice McLaurin is an exciting, informative and must-have book for children, especially of African-American descent. Have You Thanked an Inventor Today? is a beautifully illustrated children&#x2019;s book about inventions that we use every day. Children will learn that some things that we may take for granted - from the components in a cell phone, street lights, peanut butter, hair brush, lunch box, guitar, potato chips, and the ironing board to the Super Soaker water gun - were created by African-American men and women. Also African-American inventors may not have invented the following things initially, but they were responsible for improving on the operations of it: refrigerator, mop and lock. Children will not only be engaged in learning about these inventors in Have You Thanked an Inventor Today? but Patrice McLaurin has also provided a few games and exercises to help your child not only to dream, but create a platform for discovering their own invention.<br> <br> Unfortunately, there is not a lot in our history books about the hundreds, if not thousands, of contributions that minorities and particularly African-Americans have given to this world. I was honored to read such a well designed, concise and power-packed book. I enjoyed how Patrice McLaurin cleverly told the story of the African-American contribution in Have You Thanked an Inventor Today? through a little boy just starting his day. Patrice McLaurin was able to not only provide children with knowledge, but also nuggets of history through the biographies of the inventors. These inventors not only had a dream; they dared to make their dream become a reality. There are so many wonders to be seen throughout the day that were made possible because of an inventor. Ask yourself, without these inventions how would the world be for you?</p></p><h2>The Little Gardener (Teenie Greenies)</h2><p><b>Discover what it takes to become a little gardener with this interactive board book that's perfect for spring and summertime reading. </b><br><br>It takes more than just seeds and water.

Hockey Wars by Sam Lawrence and Ben Jackson is a thrilling action chapter book. Although intended for children from ages 8 to 12, younger hockey fans will also get a kick out of the feud between the two hockey teams, the Lightning and Hurricanes. Cameron and Millie, friends from a very young age, have recently become sworn enemies. As captains for opposing teams who must play against each other for the right to use an outdoor pond to train on, their relationship is threatened. Which captain will lead their team on to victory? And will Cameron and Millie realize in time that by winning they might be losing something more important than a hockey game?<br><br>Sam Lawrence and Ben Jackson have written a fast-paced story that builds in momentum, hurtling young readers towards a satisfying ending, while teaching them the value of friendship. Hockey Wars, all about high-octane excitement for hockey fans, is also a character-driven chapter book showing the growth and development of Millie and Cameron as they realize that winning may cost them more than the loss of an ice-hockey pond. The book's characters ring true to young readers as they behave in ways consistent with their age and context. Millie is strong, Cameron determined, and the rest of the characters believable and engaging. Hockey Wars draws readers irresistibly into the story while teaching a valuable life-lesson in the most natural and compelling way. Don't read it because you're a hockey fan, but simply because you're a fan of great children's fiction!

She has written many books, including the popular <em>Dino Tales: Life Guides for Families</em> series, illustrated by her husband, Marc Brown. <br><br>Marc Brown is the creator of the bestselling Arthur Adventure book series and co-developer of the children's PBS television series, Arthur. He has also created a second book series, featuring D.W., Arthur's little sister, as well as numerous other books for children. Marc Brown lives with his family in Tisbury, Massachusetts, on Martha's Vineyard.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Similar in style to the Browns' Dinosaurs Divorce (Atlantic Monthly, 1986), this picture book offers kids practical suggestions about resolving arguments, getting over being shy, handling bossy children and bullies, and more. The easy-to-read text contains many examples of how to be a friend, each paired with a picture of two or more dinosaurs in that particular situation. For example, "You can protect a friend if someone starts bothering him" is illustrated with a dinosaur saying, "Stop it! Leave him alone!" to a bully. Marc Brown's colorful, whimsical cartoons are integral to the appeal of the book. The front endpapers feature suggestions from a third-grade class on "Ways to Be a Friend" ("Be helpful," "Take turns," etc.) along with drawings of happy dinosaur faces, while at the back, "Ways Not to Be a Friend" ("Make mean faces," "Call them a name they don't like," etc.) are illustrated with grumpy faces. While there are many wonderful stories that deal with friendship, few give direct advice to children about what to do and what not to do. Sure to be a hit without hitting readers over the head with message.<br><i>Esther C.

The sky appears to rotate (due to the rotation and orbital motion of the earth), so to be successful recognizing the constellations a beginner needs to know which stars are above the horizon at any time. <p>This is the full-sized version of The Night Sky suitable for the 40°-50° latitude zone (northern United States and parts of Europe). We have versions for the following latitude zones: 50�-60�, 40�-50�, 30�-40�, 20�-30�, and the Southern Hemisphere. We also have pocket-sized versions available for the same latitude zones.</p></p><p>The Night Sky comes in two sizes: Large (8 inch diameter) and Small (5 inch diameter). The large size is best for learning the constellations. The small size is best as a pocket reference to tell you what constellations are up if you are already reasonably familiar with the constellations. In each size the charts are available for different latitude zones. <p>To find the correct size and latitude zone, use the following ISBN numbers in your Amazon.com search: </p><p>The Night Sky 50�-60� (Large), 1891938088 (Small), 1891938096 </p><p>The Night Sky 40�-50� (Large), 0961320745 (Small), 1891938010 </p><p>The Night Sky 30�-40� (Large), 0961320753 (Small), 1891938029 </p><p>The Night Sky 20�-30� (Large), 0961320761 (Small), 1891938037 </p><p>The Night Sky Southern Hemisphere (Large), 0961320737 (Small), 1891938002</p>Most planispheres attempt to represent the whole dome of the sky on one flat map, creating severe distortion near the outer edges of the map (the southern part of the sky). The Night Sky was specially designed to overcome this problem: two maps divide the sky into north-facing and south-facing views, which are shown on the front and back sides of the chart. When you turn around, simply turn the chart over. This design feature eliminates over 90% of the distortion found in conventional one-sided planispheres. <p>Other features of The Night Sky were designed with observers in mind: </p><p>--Dark stars on a white background make the map easier to read at night with a dim (or preferably red filtered) flashlight. (Under red light the dark blue of the chart becomes a velvety black.) </p><p>--The maps are computer-plotted for accuracy and show stars down to a consistent brightness cut-off. What you see on the chart is what is really there. </p><p>--The constellation figures emphasize simple patterns connecting the brightest stars, making the constellations easy to recognize and remember. </p><p>--The pocket version has fewer stars and omits some of the less conspicuous constellations to minimize clutter and maintain readability. </p><p>--The Night Sky comes in a protective vinyl pouch and the chart has plastic outer surfaces for dew resistance.</p></p><h2>Michael Vey Complete Collection Books 1-7 (Boxed Set): Michael Vey; Michael Vey 2; Michael Vey 3; Michael Vey 4; Michael Vey 5; Michael Vey 6; Michael Vey 7</h2><p>All seven electrifying books in the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Michael Vey series are now available in a collectible paperback boxed set!<br><br>To everyone at Meridian High School, Michael Vey is nothing special, just the kid who has Tourette&#x2019;s syndrome.

The brilliantly illustrated tale of mallards on the move received the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished picture book of the year, and has been a favorite of generations of readers.<br><br> Celebrate the anniversary of <i>Make Way for Ducklings</i> with this special slipcased edition, which includes an audio CD as well as a landmark poster of the ducklings&#x2019; Boston by Caldecott Award-winner Paul Zelinsky.</p><p>It's not easy for duck parents to find a safe place to bring up their ducklings, but during a rest stop in Boston's Public Garden, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard think they just might have found the perfect spot--no foxes or turtles in sight, plenty of peanuts from pleasant passers-by, and the benevolent instincts of a kindly police officer to boot. Young readers will love the mother duck's proud, loving protection of her wee webbed ones, and those with fond memories of Boston will enjoy familiar locales, from Beacon Hill to Louisburg Square, and over the Charles River--often from a duck's-eye view. Robert McCloskey, creator of <i>Blueberries for Sal</i>, never fails to elicit happy story-time giggles from youngsters, and his soft, brown-toned, Caldecott-winning illustrations make this gentle world come alive. (Ages 3 to 8) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>Robert McCloskey (1914-2003) wrote and illustrated some of the most celebrated children&#x2019;s books ever published. Both <i>Make Way for Ducklings </i>and<i> Time of Wonder </i>were awarded the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished picture book of the year, and <i>Blueberries for Sal</i> and <i>One Morning in Maine</i> were named Caldecott Honor Books.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> McCloskey grew up in Hamilton, Ohio, the setting for <i>Homer Price</i>, his portrait of a quintessential American boyhood. He studied art at Vesper George School of Art in Boston, and continued his studies at the National Academy of Design in New York. He was awarded the Prix de Rome, but delayed his study abroad until after World War II. Subsequently he and his wife, Margaret Durand, moved to Maine, where their two daughters were raised, and where McCloskey found inspiration for many of his books.<br> &nbsp;<br> Robert McCloskey&#x2019;s ducklings are immortalized as bronze statues in Boston&#x2019;s Public Gardens, and are visited by countless children. He leaves a legacy of books that have proved enduringly beloved.</p><h2>Super Cool Space Facts: A Fun, Fact-filled Space Book for Kids</h2><p><p><strong>Discover a universe of fun and amazing facts about space!</strong></p><p>Take an exciting, fact-filled journey that goes where all great space books for kids should&#x2015;to our solar system and beyond! <em>Super Cool Space Facts</em> is bursting with info about stormy planets, exploding stars, weird black holes, amazing landers, and more.</p><p>Blast past other space books for kids with:</p><ul><li><strong>Galaxies of wonder</strong>&#x2015;Launch into learning with awesome and easy-to-digest facts about everything from asteroids hurtling through space to astronauts on the International Space Station.</li><li><strong>Entertaining information</strong>&#x2015;Fill your outer space adventure with the jokes, big word alerts, and fascinating mysteries of the universe all space books for kids should have.</li><li><strong>Full-color photos</strong>&#x2015;See how cool space is with incredible pictures of stars, galaxies, planets, constellations, and more.</li></ul><p><em>Super Cool Space Facts</em> brings you out-of-this-world fun&#x2015;and a must have title for anyone interested in space books for kids.</p></p><p><p><strong>BRUCE BETTS, PHD</strong> is a planetary scientist who loves teaching people about planets, space, and the night sky in fun and entertaining ways.

She pledged herself to a religious order at the age of 18 and chose the name Sister Teresa, after the patron saint of missionaries. While teaching in India, where famine and violence had devastated the poor, Teresa shed her habit and walked the streets of Calcutta tending to the needs of the destitute. Her charity work soon expanded internationally, and her name remains synonymous with compassion and devotion to the poor.</p><p>Jim Gigliotti is a freelance writer based in Southern California. A former editor at the National Football League, he has written more than 50 books for all ages. His writing credits include biographies for young readers on Olympian Jesse Owens and baseball star Roberto Clemente.<p></p><p>Mother Teresa stared out the window of the train as it made its way from the crowded city of Calcutta, India, to the mountain resort town of Darjeeling in September 1946.</p><p>The Indian countryside was very beautiful. But the train ride took many hours. With lots of twists and turns and zigzags to get up the mountain, the train moved slowly. That was okay, though. It gave Mother Teresa plenty of time to think.</p><p>Mother Teresa was traveling from St. Mary&#x2019;s School for girls to her annual retreat in Darjeeling. A retreat is a good place to get away from the noise and distractions of everyday life, and to spend quiet time in prayer and reflection.

It&#x2019;s a hum,&#x201d; answers Plastic.<br><br> No one says anything for a while, after that.<br><br> &#x201c;Does anyone know where we&#x2019;re going in here?&#x201d; wonders Lumphy.<br><br> Plastic does not.<br><br> StingRay doesn&#x2019;t, either.<br><br> &#x201c;My stomach is uncomfortable,&#x201d; grumphs the buffalo. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to be sick.&#x201d;<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Buh-buh bump! It feels like the backpack is going down some stairs. Or maybe up some stairs.<br><br> Or maybe up something worse than stairs.<br><br> StingRay tries to think calming thoughts. She pictures the high bed with the fluffy pillows where she usually sleeps. She pictures the Little Girl with the blue barrette, who scratches where the ears would be if StingRay had ears. But none of these thoughts makes her feel calm.<br><br> &#x201c;I hope we&#x2019;re not going to the vet,&#x201d; StingRay says, finally.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the vet?&#x201d; asks Lumphy.<br><br> &#x201c;The vet is a big human dressed in a white coat who puts animals in a contraption made from rubber bands, in order to see what is wrong with them,&#x201d; answers StingRay, who sometimes says she knows things when she doesn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Then he pokes them over and over<br><br> with needles the size of carrots,<br><br> and makes them drink nasty-tasting medicine,<br><br> and puts them in the bumpity washing machine to fix whatever&#x2019;s broken.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If anyone needs to go to the vet, it&#x2019;s the one-eared sheep,&#x201d; says Plastic, remembering the oldest of the Little Girl&#x2019;s toys. &#x201c;And Sheep&#x2019;s not even here. No, we can&#x2019;t be going to the vet. We aren&#x2019;t broken.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Speak for yourself,&#x201d; snorts Lumphy, who feels even sicker than before at the thought of the bumpity washing machine.<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Woosh. Woosh. The backpack begins to swing.<br><br> Back and forth. Back and forth.<br><br> Or maybe round and round.<br><br> &#x201c;I hope we&#x2019;re not going to the zoo,&#x201d; moans StingRay.<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll put us in cages with no one to talk to. Each one in a separate cage,<br><br> and we&#x2019;ll have to woosh back and forth all day,<br><br> and do tricks on giant swings,<br><br> with people throwing quarters at our faces,<br><br> and teasing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re big enough for the zoo,&#x201d; Plastic says hopefully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure they&#x2019;re only interested in very large animals over there.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m large,&#x201d; says Lumphy.<br><br> &#x201c;She means really, really, very large,&#x201d; says StingRay. &#x201c;At the zoo they have stingrays the size of choo-choo trains;<br><br> and plastics the size of swimming pools.<br><br> Zoo buffaloes would never fit in a backpack.<br><br> They eat backpacks for lunch, those buffaloes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that true?&#x201d; asks Lumphy, but nobody answers him.<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Plunk! The backpack is thrown onto the ground.<br><br> Or maybe into a trash can.<br><br> Or onto a garbage truck.<br><br> &#x201c;We might be going to the dump!&#x201d; cries StingRay. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be tossed in a pile of old green beans,<br><br> and sour milk cartons,<br><br> because the Little Girl doesn&#x2019;t love us anymore,<br><br> and it will be icy cold all the time,<br><br> and full of garbage-eating sharks,<br><br> and it will smell like throw-up.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; soothes Plastic.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be forced to sleep on a slimy bit of used paper baggie, instead of on the big high bed with the fluffy pillows!&#x201d; continues StingRay.<br><br> There is a noise outside the backpack. Not a big noise, but a rumbly one. &#x201c;Did you hear that?&#x201d; asks StingRay. &#x201c;I think it is the X-ray machine. The vet is going to X-ray us one by one<br><br> and look into our insides with an enormous magnifying glass,<br><br> and then poke us with the giant carrot!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not an X-ray,&#x201d; says Plastic calmly, although she isn&#x2019;t sure at all. &#x201c;An X-ray would be squeakier.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then I think it is a lion,&#x201d; cries StingRay. &#x201c;A lion at the zoo who does not want to be on display with any small creatures like you and me.<br><br> A lion who doesn&#x2019;t like sharing her swing set,<br><br> and wants all the quarters for herself.<br><br> She is roaring because she hasn&#x2019;t had any lunch yet,<br><br> and her favorite food is stingrays.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A lion would be fiercer,&#x201d; says Plastic, a bit un- certainly. &#x201c;It would sound hungrier, I bet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe it is a giant buffalo,&#x201d; suggests Lumphy.<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe it is a dump truck!&#x201d; squeals StingRay. &#x201c;A big orange dump truck tipping out piles of rotten groceries on top of us,<br><br> and trapping us with the garbage-eating sharks<br><br> and the throw-up smell!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t a dump truck be louder?&#x201d; asks Plastic, though she is starting to think StingRay might have a point. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not a dump truck.&#x201d;<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> The backpack thumps down again with a bang. &#x201c;I would like to be warned,&#x201d; moans Lumphy. &#x201c;Sudden bumps make everything worse than it already is.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The Girl doesn&#x2019;t love us and she&#x2019;s trying to get rid of us!&#x201d; cries StingRay in a panic.<br><br> The backpack opens. The rumbly noise gets louder, and the light is very bright&#x2014;so bright that StingRay, Plastic, and Lumphy have to squinch up their eyes and take deep breaths before they can see where they are. A pair of warm arms takes them all out of the dark, wet-bathing-suit smell together.<br><br> The three toys look around. There are small chairs, a sunny window, and a circle of fidgety faces.<br><br> It is not the vet.<br><br> It is not the zoo.<br><br> It is not the dump. (They are pretty sure.)<br><br> But where is it?<br><br> The rumbly noise surges up. A grown-up asks everyone to Please Be Quiet Now. And then comes a familiar voice.<br><br> &#x201c;These are my best friends,&#x201d; says the Little Girl who owns the backpack and sleeps in the high bed with the fluffy pillows. &#x201c;My best friends in the world. That&#x2019;s why I brought them to show-and-tell.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; says the teacher.<br><br> Sticky, unfamiliar fingers pat Lumphy&#x2019;s head and StingRay&#x2019;s plush tail.<br><br> Plastic is held up for all to admire. &#x201c;We are here to be shown and told,&#x201d; she whispers to StingRay and Lumphy, feeling quite bouncy as she looks around at the schoolroom. &#x201c;Not to be thrown away or put under the X-ray machine!&#x201d;<br><br> The teacher says Lumphy looks a lot like a real buffalo. (Lumphy wonders what the teacher means by &#x201c;real,&#x201d; but he is too happy to worry much about it.)<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re special!&#x201d; whispers StingRay. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re her best friends!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I knew it would be something nice,&#x201d; says Plastic.<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Funny, but the ride home is not so uncomfortable. The smell is still there, but the backpack seems rather cozy. Plastic has herself a nap.<br><br> StingRay isn&#x2019; t worried about vets and zoos and gar-bage dumps anymore; she curls herself into a ball by Lumphy&#x2019;s buffalo stomach. &#x201c;The Little Girl loves us,&#x201d; she tells him. &#x201c;I knew it all along, really. I just didn&#x2019;t want to say.&#x201d;<br><br> Lumphy licks StingRay&#x2019; s head once, and settles down to wait. When he knows where he is going, traveling isn&#x2019;t so bad. And right now, he is going home.</p><h2>The Night Before New Year&#39;s</h2><p>Another title in Natasha Wing's bestselling <i>Night Before</i> series!

He is grumpy. And he is definitely not in the mood to share his home with the trio of mice who have turned his den into a hotel.<br><br>There's a possum pillow fight wreaking havoc in one room, a fox luring guests into a stew in the kitchen, and a snuggly crew of critters hogging the bed. Bruce growls and grumbles and tries to throw them all out, but the entrepreneurial mice just can't take a hint. Bruce is in a little over his head, especially once the goslings join the staff. Will this grumpy bear ever get his quiet, peaceful den back to himself? <strong>Praise for <em>Mother Bruce</em>:</strong> *"[W]ry text and marvelously detailed pictures juxtapose uproariously. . .Visually beautiful, clever, edgy, and very funny."<br> -<em>Kirkus</em>, starred review<br><br>*"Ryan T. Higgins's illustrations are extraordinary. . . . [A] hilarious, artful picture book with a nod to foodies great and small" --<em>Shelf Awareness</em>, starred review<br><br>Kids Indie Next List, Top Ten</p><p><strong>Ryan T. Higgins</strong> (ryanthiggins.com) is the author/illustrator of <em>Mother Bruce</em>. He does NOT live with four geese, but he and his family do live with a tortoise and a menagerie of other pets. At one time or another, Ryan has been friends with a porcupine, a raccoon, a beaver, dozens of mice, and a couple of squirrels, but he has never found a moose in his bed. He always peeks under the covers, though.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;In this sequel to Mother Bruce, the bear and his quartet of goslings return home from winter migration to find that some mice have moved into his home and turned it into a hotel. Staying true to character, Bruce grumpily shoos the unwanted squatters out. However, a miscellaneous cast of woodland creatures keep turning up all over his home (including in the toilet). Not surprisingly, the next morning the mice return, managing to turn the geese into bellhops. When a rowdy group of elephant tourists show up, Bruce loses his cool and sends all the visitors out into the rain. Eventually Bruce's tender heart kicks in and he invites the mice back in to likely become additions to his adopted family. The illustrations are delightful, with lots of visual humor for those who pay attention to details. Subtle gags abound in this addition to the series. Students will laugh out loud at Bruce's misfortune and cheer when he has a change of heart. VERDICT This latest installment is sure to enchant a wide audience; a recommended purchase for any library collection.&#x2014;Jasmine L.

She lives in California.Running Out of Time?<br>&nbsp;<br><br>It&#x2019;s another exciting Friday night, and I&#x2019;m curled up in bed--alone, of course--propped up by a sea of pillows, still in my lab coat, the sash so taut it&#x2019;s suffocating the purple silk dress beneath it, but I don&#x2019;t care. After a grueling day of back-to-back patients, I&#x2019;m a few minutes away from being comatose, but I&#x2019;m also hungry, which is why I&#x2019;m channel-surfing and waiting for my pizza to get here. I stop when I come to my favorite standby: Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent, even though I&#x2019;ve seen almost all of them--including the reruns. These days I usually just watch the first five or ten minutes, long enough to see Detective Goren stride onto the crime scene in his long trench coat, tilt his head to the side while he puts on those rubber gloves, rub the new growth on that beautiful square chin, and bend down to study the victim. It&#x2019;s at this moment, before he utters a word, when I usually pucker up, blow him a kiss, and then change the channel. I&#x2019;ve lusted over Detective Goren and yearned to be held against shoulders like his long before my second marriage bottomed out.<br><br>Truth be told, over the years I&#x2019;ve fallen in love every Wednesday with Gary Dourdan&#x2019;s lips as CSI Warrick Brown, and even though I was no Trekkie, Avery Brooks&#x2019;s deep baritone and sneaky smile made me say &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; aloud to the TV. I also let myself be seduced for hours in dark theaters, hypnotized by Benicio del Toro&#x2019;s dreamy eyes, even though he was a criminal. By Denzel&#x2019;s swagger when he was a slick gangster. Brad Pitt as a sexy young thief. Ken Watanabe as the most sensual samurai I wanted to ride on a horse with, and I wanted to be a black geisha and torture him until I finally let him have all of me.<br><br>I hate to admit it, but if I had the energy, I&#x2019;d kill to have sex with the first one who walked into my bedroom tonight. I&#x2019;d let him do anything he wanted to do to me. It&#x2019;s been centuries since I&#x2019;ve had sex with a real man, and I&#x2019;m not even sure I&#x2019;d remember what to do first should I ever get so lucky again. In fact, I think I&#x2019;d be too uncomfortable, not to mention scared of getting all touchy-feely, and don&#x2019;t even get me started on him seeing me naked. Hell, this is why I sleep with the remote.<br><br>When I hear the doorbell, I glance over at the broken blue clouds inside the clock on the night table. I&#x2019;ve been waiting forty minutes for this pizza, which means they&#x2019;re going to owe me a free one! I roll off the bed on my side, even though the other side has been empty for years. I walk over to the door and yell, &#x201c;Be right there!&#x201d; Then I grab my wallet out of my purse and beeline it to the front door, because I&#x2019;m starving. That is so not true. I&#x2019;m just a little hungry. I&#x2019;m trying to stop lying to myself about little things. I&#x2019;m still working on the big ones.<br><br>I open the door, and standing there sweating is a young black kid who can&#x2019;t be more than eighteen. His head looks like a small globe of shiny black twists that I know are baby dreadlocks. His cheeks are full of brand-new zits. His name tag says free.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry for the delay, ma&#x2019;am. There was a accident at the bottom of the hill, and I couldn&#x2019;t get up here, so this one&#x2019;s on the house.&#x201d;<br><br>He looks so sad, and I&#x2019;m wondering if the price of this pizza is going to be deducted from his little paycheck, but I dare not ask.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind paying for it,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t your fault there was an accident.&#x201d; I take the pizza from him and set it on the metal stairwell.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s real thoughtful of you, but I&#x2019;m just glad this is my last delivery for the night,&#x201d; he says, leaning to one side as if he&#x2019;s pretending not to look behind me, but of course he is. &#x201c;This a real nice crib you got here. I ain&#x2019;t never seen no yellow floors before. It&#x2019;s downright wicked.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I say, and hand him a twenty.<br><br>He looks as if he&#x2019;s in shock. &#x201c;Like I said, ma&#x2019;am, this pizza is on the house, and I also got some drink coupons you can have, too,&#x201d; he says, pulling them out of the pocket of his red shirt.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a tip,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Is your real name Free?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you feel about it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I dig it. I get asked all the time about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So how old are you, Free?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m eighteen.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s still staring at the twenty but then quickly shoves it inside the back pocket of his jeans in case I come to my senses and change my mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Are you in college?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m hoping he says yes and that he&#x2019;s taking English so one day soon he&#x2019;ll stop saying ain&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m working. You really giving me this whole twenty?&#x201d;<br><br>I nod. &#x201c;Do you know what you want to major in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mechanical engineering,&#x201d; he says with certainty.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your husband rich?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What makes you think I&#x2019;d have to have a husband to be rich?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everybody that live up in these hills is. Even them two dykes that live next door. And they married.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those dykes aren&#x2019;t just my neighbors, they&#x2019;re also my friends, and they&#x2019;re lesbians.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A&#x2019;right. My bad,&#x201d; he says, flinging his arms up like Don&#x2019;t shoot. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean no harm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. Anyway, I&#x2019;m divorced. And I&#x2019;m not rich. But I also don&#x2019;t struggle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You cleaned him out, then, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>Then he gives me the once-over. &#x201c;You some kind of doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>I look down at my lab coat. &#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;m an optometrist.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which one is that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I help people see clearly,&#x201d; I say, so as not to complicate it.<br><br>&#x201c;Who helps you?&#x201d; he asks with a smile, which throws me off completely. What a loaded question to ask a woman old enough to be his grandmother. &#x201c;Just fooling with you, Dr. Young. No disrespect intended.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None taken, Free.&#x201d;<br><br>Who helps me see? See what?<br><br>&#x201c;Cool. Well, look, I gotta dash and get this car back to my cousin, but major thanks for the mega-tip, and I have to say it&#x2019;s nice somebody black gave it to me. Most of the white folks up here ain&#x2019;t big on tipping, except for them lesbians.&#x201d;<br><br>What he just said was a little on the racist and sexist side, but I know he meant well. He runs down the sidewalk and jumps into that raggedy car of his, removes the pizza sign displayed on top, and disappears down the hill. I lean against the doorframe watching him go. I really should&#x2019;ve praised him for working to pay for college, and if he hadn&#x2019;t been in such a hurry, I would have loved to tell him that he might find his calling in college and he might not. But I&#x2019;d also tell him to search until he did. Otherwise he could end up doing something he just happened to be good at, something respectable that might guarantee him a nice income, but one day, when he&#x2019;s older, like, say, fifty-three soon to be fifty-four, when his kids have grown up and he&#x2019;s twice divorced and bored with his profession and his life and the thought of trying to change it all--or even where he lives--scares the hell out of him because it feels like it&#x2019;s too late, I&#x2019;d tell him to please figure out a way to do it anyway, since I&#x2019;m an excellent example of what can happen when you don&#x2019;t.<br><br>I turn off the porch light, close the door, and I can&#x2019;t believe all of this is flooding in. I walk across these cool yellow concrete floors and sit on these cool metal stairs and look out at the light jutting up through those soft navy blue waves in the cool black-bottomed pool, and I look up a flight where both of my daughters used to sleep, and I look down to where the library and the guest room are, and I sit here and eat this entire cheese-and-tomato pizza.<br><br>I am full of regret.<br><br>Monday mornings are the worst, which is why I left a little early. The freeway is still slow going. But I&#x2019;m used to it. I crack my window, although it can&#x2019;t be more than fifty degrees. The dampness coming from the bay can&#x2019;t eclipse the clarity of this morning as thousands of us slowly descend around a curve, and there waiting for us like a giant postcard is the Bay Bridge and right behind it the San Francisco skyline. This is a beautiful place to live.<br><br>But then, as typically happens at least once a week, the traffic suddenly comes to a screeching halt. I can see the reason up ahead. A four-car pile-up is blocking two of the five lanes, and everyone is trying to move over to make room for the fire trucks and ambulances I now hear. I just pray no one is hurt. I roll my window all the way down and put the car in park. Some have already turned off their engines. I leave mine running and call my office.<br><br>When my cell phone rings, I know who it is before I even glance at the screen. &#x201c;Hello, Miss Early,&#x201d; I say to my mother, for obvious reasons but also because her name is Earlene.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello back to you, Miss Georgia.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course I was never any Miss Georgia, because I was born in Bakersfield, where she still lives, and I was named after my late father, whose name was George. There&#x2019;s hardly a day that goes by when someone doesn&#x2019;t ask me if I&#x2019;m from Georgia. In college I just started lying and said yes: Macon. But then they wanted to know why I didn&#x2019;t have a drawl.<br><br>&#x201c;What can I do you for, ma&#x2019;am? Are you feeling okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m probably healthier than you. Anyway, I&#x2019;m calling for two reasons. I&#x2019;m going on a cruise for seniors with my church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; I say, trying not to laugh, because I&#x2019;m thinking this is going to be one wild and scandalous cruise.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all you have to say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thrilled for you, Ma. I know you go to one of those megachurches, but are there enough seniors in the congregation to fill a whole cruise ship?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not. There are ten churches, and we&#x2019;re not going to be the only older people on it.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;s eighty-one. Soon to be eighty-two.<br><br>&#x201c;When and where are you going?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We leave two weeks and one day from today. For ten whole days! We&#x2019;re going to four or five islands in the Caribbean that I can&#x2019;t remember right now. One of them is the Grand Cayman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a whole lot of numbers, Ma, but it sounds like so much fun. It&#x2019;ll be good for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. I still miss your brother and your dad, and I get lonely in this condo, and I&#x2019;ll just go on and admit that I get tired of going to church just so I can have a social life and I don&#x2019;t have to get dressed up to worship at home. Anyway, I&#x2019;ll be doing a lot of praying standing in front of those slots.&#x201d; She laughs.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Ma, what&#x2019;s the other thing? Because I&#x2019;m stuck in traffic, and it looks like it&#x2019;s about to start moving.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you know it&#x2019;s almost time for my annual eye exam, and my cruise conflicts with the date I have on my calendar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ma, it&#x2019;s not set in stone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. So I&#x2019;m hoping to get a rain check to see if we can make it after the holidays, unless you think I need to have it sooner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ma, you don&#x2019;t have to have the test on the same day every year, but around the same time is just smart to do at your age.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not senile yet, Georgia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not even going to respond to that. And who is we? Please don&#x2019;t say Dolly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not safe for me to drive that far alone anymore, so Dolly is willing to do the driving.&#x201d;<br><br>Why me, Lord? Dolly is my older second cousin, whom I love but don&#x2019;t like that much, because she&#x2019;s got a nasty attitude and never has anything nice to say about anybody, especially me. I know this to be true, because gossip travels faster within families. She has convinced herself that I think I&#x2019;m hot shit because I went to college and live in a nice house with a pool. Some relatives I can live without, and Dolly&#x2019;s on the top of that list.<br><br>&#x201c;The boys want to come, too. They haven&#x2019;t seen you in years, and they&#x2019;ve been having a hard time finding work.&#x201d;<br><br>The boys are over thirty. And haven&#x2019;t worked in years either. Last time they were here, they smoked marijuana in the bathroom and tried to drink up half the liquor in the bar.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m about to start remodeling, so there&#x2019;ll be no place for them to sleep,&#x201d; I lie.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s about time. And I hope you tone it down some. I feel like I&#x2019;m walking into a rainbow every time I come through your front door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gotta go. Love you.&#x201d; I usually give her smooches, but she just hurt my feelings, so I don&#x2019;t much feel like it.<br><br>I rush past the tall wall of windows, and Marina, our six-foot Japanese receptionist, waves at me. She&#x2019;s on the phone, sitting behind the long maple counter. In the four years she&#x2019;s worked here, she&#x2019;s worn black every single day--including on her fingernails. From here you can see only her shoulders. She waves, then gives me a slow thumbs-up that all is fine. I wasn&#x2019;t really worried, but I don&#x2019;t like to inconvenience patients, even though the situation is more often the reverse.<br><br>Unlike home, the office is serene. The walls are a pale gray, a warm yellow, and one is white. My mother approves. Nine chairs are white, except for one that&#x2019;s yellow. Four oblong purple tables are scattered around the area meant for fitting eyewear. Almost every inch of wall space is filled with frames and sunglasses to suit almost every taste and price.<br><br>One of my most annoying but favorite patients, Mona Kwon, rushes to open the door for me. &#x201c;Thank you, Mona!&#x201d; I say, and head on over to Marina. Mona sits in her chair; the one next to the door if it&#x2019;s empty, or else she&#x2019;ll stand. She&#x2019;ll be seventy-five soon. She only needs strong readers but claims she can&#x2019;t see the tips of her fingernails when she holds them out in front of her. She comes in to have her glasses adjusted at least twice a month. She has forty pair and counting. The techs think she&#x2019;s probably suffering from dementia. I think she&#x2019;s just lonely. She also doesn&#x2019;t like the techs to warm her frames; she insists I do it. After lifting them out of the hot sand and slipping them behind her ears, I watch her stare into the mirror a few minutes too long, as if, or until, she&#x2019;s satisfied she looks like whoever she wants to be.</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears: That&#39;s So Rude!</h2><p><p><strong>The Berenstain Bears practice their manners!</strong></p><p>Sometimes you get up on the wrong side of the bed.

A self-described research junkie, she has parlayed her interest in police procedure, cutting edge forensics, and twisted plots into a streak of 11 bestselling suspense novels, including her most recent release, <em> The Neighbor</em>. Read her guest review of <i>Still Missing</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p> Heading to a beach? Boy do I have the book for you! </p> <p> Every now and then a new author comes along that totally knocks one out of the park. As a reader, I&#x2019;m always thrilled to discover a great new voice. As a writer, of course I&#x2019;m insanely jealous and suffer a terrible case of why-didn&#x2019;t-I-think-of-that? Given that debut author Chevy Stevens is young, beautiful and talented, I&#x2019;ve been gnashing my teeth for months! </p> <p> <i>Still Missing</i> represents psychological suspense at its very best. Realtor Annie O&#x2019;Sullivan is abducted from an open house and held captive for a year in a remote cabin by a sadistic survivalist who considers her to be his wife as well as preferred breeding stock. His goal is to get her pregnant and live creepily-ever-after as the last man and woman on earth. Her goal is to get away from him. </p> <p> Now, you know Annie wins this war as the book opens with her talking to a therapist. So you may ask, where is the suspense? I can&#x2019;t give you a simple answer to that, other than to say every page crackles with it. </p> <p> <i>Still Missing</i> creates one of the most haunting narratives I&#x2019;ve read in years. On the one hand, survivor Annie is tough, angry, and brittle. The very worst has happened to her, and she escaped through her own ingenuity and frankly, savagery. On the other hand, survivor Annie is jumpy, terrified, and sleep-deprived. All these months later, she still can&#x2019;t pee &#x201c;off schedule.&#x201d; In one of the more moving scenes of the novel, she downs a gallon of iced tea in order to force herself to urinate by her own free will. She can&#x2019;t do it. </p> <p> In addition to her compelling heroine, Stevens has created one of the best psychopaths since Hannibal Lecter&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s not something I say lightly. Annie refers to her captor simply as The Freak. Much like Hannibal, The Freak considers himself to be a civilized human being. Intelligent, good looking and resourceful, he&#x2019;s an excellent &#x201c;husband.&#x201d; He has provided a charming cabin. He supplies fresh food&#x2014;sometimes so fresh that city slicker Annie must bleed it out first, but details, details. Of course he has expectations of his wife. She must be well groomed, properly garbed, and 100% submissive. All failures to comply are met with The Freak&#x2019;s idea of appropriate punishment. The Freak is also thoughtful and tender. Want to stop sleeping for a few nights? Read the scene where The Freak first shaves Annie. And he means it in the nicest sort of way. </p> <p> Stevens skillfully juxtaposes the back story of Annie&#x2019;s captivity with the front story of a woman desperately trying to reclaim her old life. As with all great suspense novels, the surprises abound. Annie thought she&#x2019;d survived the worst with The Freak. But has she? </p> <p> As the taut cat and mouse game unfolds, you will cheer for Annie. You will hate The Freak. And you will be absolutely mesmerized by the last line of this novel. Then, most likely, you will return to page one, and start it all over again. </p> <p>So give yourself a summer vacation.

But chameleons change color wherever they go. "On lemons they are yellow. In the heather they are purple." One chameleon is not pleased with his changeable appearance. He thinks, "If I remain on a leaf, I shall be green forever, and so I too will have a color of my own." Of course, what he doesn't take into account is the changes wrought by autumn, and soon the green chameleon is yellow, then red, and then tumbled to the ground for the long black winter night. It isn't until he befriends another older, wiser chameleon that our hero begins to find inner peace, even as his outer surface is transformed again and again.<p> Leo Lionni, children's book creator extraordinaire, author of such beloved picture books as <i>Frederick</i>, <i>Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse</i>, <i>Swimmy</i>, and <i>Inch by Inch</i>, all Caldecott Honor winners, introduces color concepts in an exquisite and touching story.

Outreach Bible containing a mini dictionary, maps, book introductions and outlines, guides to reading the Bible, readings for special days, and famous passages in the Bible.</p><p>The AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY is an interdenominational, donor- supported, nonprofit ministry whose mission is to make accurate and affordable translations of the Bible available to everyone. Founded in New York City in 1816, ABS is dedicated to the purpose of presenting the Bible in compelling ways, enabling readers to experience life in its fullness through faith in Jesus Christ. ABS has a number of &#34;firsts&#34; in its record books: the first Bibles in hotels, the first pocket Bibles for soldiers (during the Civil war), and the first Bibles provided for the U.S. Military in 1817. The Society extends its outreach internationally through the United Bible Societies (UBS), a fellowship of 126 international Bible societies, and was instrumental in founding this global fellowship in the interest of greater ministry impact and efficiency. In 1999 alone, more than 63 million copies of the Society&#39;s publications were distributed throughout the United States and the world. The CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH VERSION was published by the American Bible Society in response to an urgent need for a translation that would reach those many millions who are not reading the Bible. The goal was a Bible that is a serious translation-not a paraphrase-that combines historical and scholarly accuracy with contemporary language that everyone can understand. The result is a Bible that resonates with all people, wherever they may be in their spiritual journey. At last, a Bible that is easy to read, yet allows for a deeper connection to the very God who created us. Never before has there been a Bible that speaks so clearly to the heart and the mind of every reader.</p><h2>You Are a F*cking Awesome Mom</h2><p><b>A much-needed voice of encouragement for every woman who had a baby and lost her mind</b><br><br>Sometimes, motherhood feels <i>never-ending</i>.

In the middle is a colorful illustration by Shepard chosen at random from one of Milne's books. Beneath that is another drawing of a person either signing or finger spelling the object, person, or action depicted. There is no consistency or relationship among the pictures. Few if any of the signs would be used by someone learning sign language, especially since some are proper names found only in the Milne books. The signed alphabet and numbers on the endpapers can readily be found elsewhere, so even that inclusion adds nothing to this pointless book.

She lives in Portland, Oregon.</p>K-Gr 2&#x2014;Tillman describes a heaven for animals that is a magical place. Angels know every dog's name and its favorite games, and all of the creatures coexist peacefully. A gorilla is eye to eye wth a cat, a dog is curled up with a buffalo, etc. The digitally rendered illustrations feature an idyllic landscape suffused with light and are the best part of the book. All of the angels depicted are small children. Unfortunately, the text consists of awkward rhyming couplets whose meaning is sometimes fuzzy. "I think that maybe it's heaven they see,/beyond what their wishes/could wish it to be." Also, while angels abound, there is no mention of God. Cynthia Rylant's Dog Heaven (1995) and Cat Heaven (1997, both Scholastic) are better choices, as they both address the issue without the sentimentality.&#x2014;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</p><h2>NIV, Adventure Bible, Paperback, Full Color</h2><p><p><strong>Take your kids on an adventure through God&#x2019;s Word with the #1 Bible for kids!</strong></p><p>The bestselling <em>NIV Adventure Bible</em> will get kids excited about reading the Scriptures!

He lives with his wife and children in South Carolina.Resolutions <p>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?" <br>John 21:15 </p><p>Jesus has a wonderful way of restoring us when we fail Him! He does not humiliate us. He does not criticize us. He does not ask us to make a resolution to try harder. Rather, He takes us aside and asks us to reaffirm our love for Him. </p><p>Peter miserably failed his Lord when he fled with the other disciples from the Garden of Gethsemane. Later, he publicly denied that he even knew Jesus. Peter must have wondered if he had been capable of being Jesus&#x2019; disciple when he was unfaithful to Jesus in His most crucial hour. </p><p>As you begin a new year, you may be painfully aware that you have failed your Lord in many ways. Perhaps you were not faithful. Perhaps you disobeyed His word to you. Perhaps you denied Him by the way you lived. Jesus will take you aside, as He did Peter. He will not berate you. He will not humiliate you. He will ask you to examine your love for Him. He asked Peter, "Do you love Me?" If your answer, like Peter&#x2019;s, is "Yes, Lord," He will reaffirm His will for you. If you truly love Him, you will obey Him (John 14:15). Jesus does not need your resolutions, your recommitments, or your promises to try harder this year. If your resolve to obey God last year did not help you to be faithful, it will not make you successful this year. Jesus asks for your love. If you truly love Him, your service for Him in the new year will be of the quality that He desires. </p><p>Woe Is Me! </p><p>So I said: "Woe is me, for I am undone!<br> Because I am a man of unclean lips,<br> And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;<br> For my eyes have seen the King,<br> The Lord of hosts."<br> Isaiah 6:5 </p><p>An exalted view of God brings a clear view of sin and a realistic view of self. A diminished view of God brings a reduced concern for sin and an inflated view of self. Isaiah may have been satisfied with his personal holiness until he saw the Lord in His unspeakable glory. Isaiah&#x2019;s encounter with holy God made him immediately and keenly aware of his own unholiness and the sinfulness of those around him. It is impossible to worship God and remain unchanged. The best indication that we have truly worshiped is a changed heart. </p><p>Have we so conformed ourselves to a sinful world that we are satisfied with unholy living? Have we sunk so far below God&#x2019;s standard that when someone does live as God intended, we consider that person "superspiritual"? If we only compare our personal holiness to those around us, we may be deceived into believing that we are living a consecrated life. Yet when we encounter holy God, our only response can be "Woe is me!" </p><p>You will not see those around you trusting Jesus until they recognize a clear difference between you and the rest of the world. God wants to sanctify you as He is holy. When God deals with you, there will be a radical degree of purity about your life that is absolutely different from what the world can produce. The world, including those closest to you, will be convinced you serve a holy God by your consecrated life. </p><p>Making a Difference </p><p>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies. <br>Daniel 1:8 </p><p>Would you dare to believe that God, who called you to Himself and equipped you with His Spirit, could work mightily through you? Have you made the connection between the time and place in which you live and God&#x2019;s call upon you? World events never catch God by surprise. He placed you precisely where you are for a purpose. </p><p>Daniel did not let the temptations of his day interfere with his relationship to the Lord. He knew that to make his life useful to God he must be obedient in all things. Regardless of what the most powerful king in the world commanded, Daniel refused to compromise what he knew God required of him. </p><p>History is replete with examples of Christian men and women who believed that God would work through them to make a significant difference for His kingdom. God placed Esther strategically in the king&#x2019;s court at a crucial time when she could save the lives of God&#x2019;s people (Esther 4:14). God placed Joseph strategically to become the most powerful adviser to the pharaoh in Egypt and to save Jacob and his family from a devastating drought (Gen. 41:39&#x2013;40). </p><p>Are you allowing your surroundings to determine how you invest your life? Or are you letting God use you to make a difference in your generation? Ask God to reveal His purposes for you and His will for your life today.</p></p><h2>Harry Potter Magical Places &amp; Characters Coloring Book: Official Coloring Book, The</h2><p>Explore the many places and characters of the Harry Potter films through the magic of color.

Wolfelt, whose decades of experience in grief work with teens informs his ideas, offers 100 ways to facilitate grieving and come to terms with loss.

A hungry fox is sure that it's his lucky day when a delectable-looking pig knocks on his door by mistake. Mr. Fox grabs his squealing guest and starts to prepare a feast, but the pig asks him to wait, pointing out, "I'm filthy. Shouldn't you wash me first?" The fox prepares a lovely bath and the pig compliments him on being "a terrific scrubber." But then, the pig continues, shouldn't he be fattened up a bit? And shouldn't he be massaged so that he won't be tough? Mr. Fox grudgingly complies with these requests and soon finds himself so exhausted that "He couldn't lift a finger, let alone a roasting pan." The pig heads home, clean, well fed, relaxed, and ready to plan his next call on an unsuspecting predator. Set against white backgrounds, the lively gouache illustrations enhance the humorous and witty text. The fox's facial expressions clearly reflect his range of emotions, as he goes from sheer elation to pure exhaustion. He is as gullible and endearing as the pig is sly and charming.

For Therese, concerned about Bill&#x2019;s failing heart and dreading Cecily's impending independence, all would be well if only Cecily would marry Mack, the hotel's manager, who loves the Beach Club as if it were his own&#x2014;though he has a long-term girlfriend, Maribel, who is desperate for him to propose. On top of all this, the head bellman, Vance, having lost the manager's job to Mack 12 years ago, has marked this as the summer when he'll finally take his revenge. At the center of all the turmoil, easygoing Mack simply wants everyone off his back while he decides whether to make the alluring island his home or return to his farm in Iowa. With Maribel pursuing Mack, Jem (another bellman) pursuing Maribel, Vance pursuing Love, and Love pursuing everyone, the club is awash with hormones, and quarrels break from one minute to the next. The ever-changing cast of hotel guests&#x2014;a sexy suspected drug dealer, an extracurricular flame of Mack's, a generous dying man&#x2014;adds to the mix. After a crescendo that begins with Vance taking Mack's decision into his own hands and culminates with a hurricane that leaves the hotel engulfed in sand, the characters find all their obsessive needs gone&#x2014;carried off, as if by the wind&#x2014;letting peace reign. A feisty, evanescent first novel, lively enough to keep a sunbather awake.Literary Guild selection -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

The humming fan on her dresser stirred it, but it was like sleeping in the steam pumping off the pot.</p><p>Still, she was used to that, to lying on top of summer-moist sheets, with the windows open wide to the relentless chorus of cicadas&#x2014;and the faint hope even a tiny breeze would slither through the sultry.</p><p>The heat didn&#x2019;t wake her, nor did the soft rumble of thunder from a storm gathering in the distance. Naomi went from sleep to awake in an instant, as if someone had given her a good shake or shouted her name in her ear.</p><p>She sat straight up in bed, blinking at the dark, hearing nothing but the hum of the fan, the high pitch of the cicadas, and the lazy, repetitive hoo of an owl. All country summer sounds she knew as well as her own voice, and nothing to put that odd little click in her throat.</p><p>But now, awake, she felt that heat, like gauze soaked in hot water and wrapped around every inch of her. She wished it were morning so she could sneak out before anyone was up and cool off in the creek.</p><p>Chores came first, that was the rule. But it was so hot it felt like she&#x2019;d have to part the air like a curtain just to take a step. And it was Saturday (or would be in the morning) and sometimes Mama let the rules slide a little on Saturdays&#x2014;if Daddy was in a good mood.</p><p>Then she heard that rumble of thunder. Delighted, she scrambled out of bed to rush to her window. She loved storms, the way they whirled and swung through the trees, the way the sky went spooky, the way lightning slashed and flashed.</p><p>And maybe this storm would bring rain and wind and cooler air. Maybe.</p><p>She knelt on the floor, her arms folded on the windowsill, her eyes on the bit of moon hazed by heat and clouds.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>She wished for it&#x2014;a girl who&#x2019;d turn twelve in just two days and still believed in wishes. A big storm, she thought, with lightning like pitchforks and thunder like cannon fire.</p><p>And lots and lots of rain.</p><p>She closed her eyes, tipped her face up, tried sniffing the air. Then, in her Sabrina the Teenage Witch T-shirt, she pillowed her head on her hands and studied the shadows.</p><p>Again she wished for morning, and since wishes were free, wished it were the morning of her birthday. She wanted a new bike so bad, and she&#x2019;d given out plenty of hints.</p><p>She knelt, wanting morning, a girl tall and gawky, who&#x2014;though she checked daily&#x2014;was not yet growing breasts. The heat had her hair sticking to her neck. Annoyed with it, she pushed it up, off, let it hang over her shoulder. She wanted to cut it&#x2014;really short, like a pixie in the fairy-tale book her grandparents had given her before they weren&#x2019;t allowed to see each other anymore.</p><p>But Daddy said girls were supposed to have long hair, and boys short. So her little brother got a crew cut down at Vick&#x2019;s Barbershop in town, and all she could do was pull her sort-of-blonde hair back in a ponytail.</p><p>But then Mason got spoiled silly, in her opinion, being the boy. He&#x2019;d gotten a basketball hoop and a backboard, with an official Wilson basketball for his birthday. He got to play Little League baseball, too&#x2014;something that by Daddy&#x2019;s rules was only for boys (something Mason never let her forget)&#x2014;and being younger by twenty-three months (something she didn&#x2019;t let him forget), he didn&#x2019;t have as many chores.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t fair, but saying so only added on more chores and risked losing TV privileges.</p><p>Besides, she wouldn&#x2019;t care about any of that if she got the new bike.</p><p>She caught a dull flash&#x2014;just a shimmer of lightning low in the sky. It would come, she told herself. The wish storm would come and bring the cool and wet. If it rained and rained and rained, she wouldn&#x2019;t have to weed the garden.</p><p>The idea of that excited her enough that she nearly missed the next flash.</p><p>Not lightning this time, but the beam from a flashlight.</p><p>Her first thought was someone was poking around, maybe trying to break in. She started to stand up, run for her father.</p><p>Then she saw that it was her father. Moving away from the house toward the tree line, moving quick and sure in the beam of the light.</p><p>Maybe he was going to the creek to cool off. If she went, too, how could he be mad? If he was in a good mood, he&#x2019;d laugh.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t think twice, just grabbed up her flip-flops, stuck her tiny flashlight in her pocket, and hurried out of the room, quiet as a mouse.</p><p>She knew which steps creaked&#x2014;everybody did&#x2014;and avoided them out of habit. Daddy didn&#x2019;t like it if she or Mason snuck downstairs for a drink after bedtime.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t put the flip-flops on until she reached the back door, then eased it open just enough&#x2014;before it could creak&#x2014;to squeeze out.</p><p>For a minute she thought she&#x2019;d lost the trail of the flashlight, but she caught it again and darted after. She&#x2019;d hang back until she gauged her father&#x2019;s mood.</p><p>But he veered off from the shallow ribbon of the creek, moving deeper into the woods that edged that scrap of land.</p><p>Where could he be going? Curiosity pushed her on, and the almost giddy excitement of sneaking through the woods in the dead of night. The rumbles and flashes from the sky only added to the adventure.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t know fear, though she&#x2019;d never gone this deep into the woods&#x2014;it was forbidden. Her mother would tan her hide if she got caught, so she wouldn&#x2019;t get caught.</p><p>Her father moved quick and sure, so he knew where he was going. She could hear his boots crunching old dried leaves on the skinny trail, so she kept back. It wouldn&#x2019;t do for him to hear her.</p><p>Something screeched, made her jump a little. She had to slap her hand over her mouth to muffle the giggle. Just an old owl, out on the hunt.</p><p>The clouds shifted, covered the moon. She nearly stumbled when she stubbed her bare toe on a rock, and again she covered her mouth to smother her hiss of pain.</p><p>Her father stopped, making her heart pound like a drum. She went still as a statue, barely breathing. For the first time she wondered what she&#x2019;d do if he turned around, came back toward her. Couldn&#x2019;t run, she thought, for he&#x2019;d surely hear that. Maybe she could creep off the path, hide in the brush. And just hope there weren&#x2019;t snakes sleeping.</p><p>When he moved on she continued to stand, telling herself to go back before she got into really big trouble. But the light was like a magnet and drew her on.</p><p>It bobbled and shook for a moment. She heard something rattle and scrape, something creak like the back door.</p><p>Then the light vanished.</p><p>She stood in the deep, dark woods, breath shallow, and cold prickling over her skin despite the hot, heavy air. She took a step back, then two, as the urge to run fell over her.</p><p>The click came back to her throat, so sharp she could barely swallow. And the dark, all the dark seemed to wrap around her&#x2014;too tight.</p><p>Run home, run. Get back in bed, close your eyes. The voice in her head pitched high and shrill like the cicadas.</p><p>&#x201c;Scaredy-cat,&#x201d; she whispered, clutching her own arms for courage. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a scaredy-cat.&#x201d;</p><p>She crept forward, almost feeling her way now. Once again the clouds shifted, and in the thin trickle of moonlight she saw the silhouette of a ruined building.</p><p>Like an old cabin, she thought, that had burned down so only the jags of foundation and an old chimney remained.</p><p>The odd fear slid away into fascination with the shapes, the grays of it all, the way the thin moonlight played over the scorched bricks, the blackened wood.</p><p>Again she wished for morning so she could explore. If she could sneak back here in the light, it could be her place. A place where she could bring her books and read&#x2014;without her brother nagging at her. And she could sit and draw or just sit and dream.</p><p>Someone had lived there once, so maybe there were ghosts. And that idea was a thrill. She&#x2019;d just love to meet a ghost.</p><p>But where had her father gone?</p><p>She thought of the rattles and creak again. Maybe this was like another dimension, and he&#x2019;d opened a door to it, gone through.</p><p>He had secrets&#x2014;she figured all adults did. Secrets they kept from everybody, secrets that made their eyes go hard if you asked the wrong question. Maybe he was an explorer, one who went through a magic door to another world.</p><p>He wouldn&#x2019;t like her thinking it because other worlds, like ghosts and teenage witches, weren&#x2019;t in the Bible. But maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t like her thinking it because it was true.</p><p>She risked a few more steps forward, ears cocked for any sound. And heard only the thunder, rolling closer.</p><p>This time when she stubbed her toe, the quick cry of pain escaped, and she hopped on one foot until the sting eased. Stupid rock, she thought, and glanced down.</p><p>In that pale moonlight she saw not a rock, but a door. A door in the ground! A door that would creak when opened. Maybe a magic door.</p><p>She got down on all fours, ran her hands over it&#x2014;and got a splinter for her trouble.</p><p>Magic doors didn&#x2019;t give you splinters. Just an old root cellar, or storm cellar. But though disappointment dampened her spirits as she sucked her sore finger, it was still a door in the ground in the woods by an old burned-out cabin.</p><p>And her father had gone down there.</p><p>Her bike! Maybe he&#x2019;d hidden her bike down there and was right now putting it together. Willing to risk another splinter, she put her ear to the old wood, squeezing her eyes tight to help her hear.</p><p>She thought she heard him moving around. And he was making a kind of grunting noise. She imagined him assembling her bike&#x2014;all shiny and new and red&#x2014;his big hands picking the right tool, and whistling through his teeth the way he did when he worked on something.</p><p>He was down there doing something special just for her. She wouldn&#x2019;t complain (in her head) about chores for a whole month.</p><p>How long did it take to put a bike together? She should hurry back home so he didn&#x2019;t know she&#x2019;d followed him. But she really, really, really wanted to see it. Just a peek.</p><p>She eased back from the door, crept over to the burned-out cabin, and hunkered down behind the old chimney. It wouldn&#x2019;t take him long&#x2014;he was good with tools. He could have his own repair shop if he wanted and only worked for the cable company out of Morgantown to provide security for his family.</p><p>He said so all the time.</p><p>She glanced up at the snap of lightning&#x2014;the first pitchfork of it&#x2014;and the thunder that followed was more boom than mumble. She should&#x2019;ve gone home, that was the truth, but she couldn&#x2019;t go back now. He could come out any time, and he&#x2019;d catch her for sure.</p><p>There&#x2019;d be no shiny red bike for her birthday if he caught her now.</p><p>If the storm broke, she&#x2019;d just get wet, that&#x2019;s all. It would cool her off.</p><p>She told herself he&#x2019;d just be five more minutes, and when the minutes passed, he&#x2019;d just be five more. And then she had to pee. She tried to hold it, ignore it, squeeze it back, but in the end, she gave up and crept her way farther back, back into the trees.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, pulled down her shorts, and crouched, keeping her feet wide to avoid the stream. Then she shook and shook until she was as dry as she was going to get. Just as she started to pull her pants back up, the door creaked open.</p><p>She froze, pants around her knees, bare butt inches off the ground, her lips pressed tight to hold back her breath.</p><p>She saw him in the next flash of lightning, and he looked wild to her&#x2014;his close-cropped hair almost white in the storm light, his eyes so dark, and his teeth showing in a fierce grin.</p><p>Seeing him, half expecting him to throw back his head and howl like a wolf, she felt her heart thudding with the first true fear she&#x2019;d ever known.</p><p>When he rubbed himself, down there, she felt her cheeks go hot as fire. Then he closed the door, the quick slam of it echoing. He shot the bolt home&#x2014;a hard, scraping sound that made her shiver. Her legs trembled from holding the awkward position while he tossed layers of old leaves over the door.</p><p>He stood a moment more&#x2014;and oh, the lightning sizzled now&#x2014;and played the beam of his light over the door. The backwash of it threw his face into relief so she saw only the hard edges, and the light, close-cropped hair made it look like a skull, eyes dark, soulless hollows.</p><p>He looked around, and for one terrible moment she feared he looked right at her. This man, she knew into her bones, would hurt her, would use hands and fists on her like the father who worked to provide security for his family never had.</p><p>With a helpless whimper in her throat, she thought: Please, Daddy. Please.</p><p>But he turned away, and with long, sure strides, went back the way he&#x2019;d come.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t move a trembling muscle until she heard nothing but the night song, and the first stirring of the wind. The storm was rolling in, but her father was gone.</p><p>She hiked up her pants and straightened, rubbing the pins and needles out of her legs.</p><p>No moon now, and all sense of adventure had dropped into a terrible dread.</p><p>But her eyes had adjusted enough for her to pick her way back to the leaf-covered door. She saw it only because she knew it was there.</p><p>She could hear her own breath now, wisping away on the swirl of wind. Cool air, but now she wanted warm. Her bones felt cold, like winter cold, and her hand shook as she bent down to brush the thick layers of leaves away.</p><p>She stared at the bolt, thick and rusted, barring the old wood door. Her fingers traced over it, but she didn&#x2019;t want to open it now. She wanted to be back in her own bed, safe. She didn&#x2019;t want that picture of her father, that wild picture.</p><p>But her fingers tugged on the bolt, and then she used her hands as it resisted. She set her teeth when it scraped open.</p><p>It was her bike, she told herself even while a terrible weight settled in her chest. Her shiny red birthday bike. That was what she would find.</p><p>Slowly, she lifted the door, looked down into the dark.</p><p>She swallowed hard, took the little flashlight out of her pocket, and, using its narrow beam, made her way down the ladder.</p><p>She had a sudden fear of her father&#x2019;s face appearing in the opening. That wild and terrible look on his face. And that door slamming shut, closing her in. She nearly scrambled back up again, but she heard the whimper.</p><p>She froze on the ladder.</p><p>An animal was down here. Why would her daddy have an animal down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A puppy? Was that her birthday surprise? The puppy she&#x2019;d always wanted, but wasn&#x2019;t allowed to have. Even Mason couldn&#x2019;t beg them a puppy.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes as she dropped down to the dirt floor. She&#x2019;d have to pray for forgiveness for the awful thoughts&#x2014;thoughts were a sin as much as deeds&#x2014;she&#x2019;d had about her father.</p><p>She swung her light around, her heart full of wonder and joy&#x2014;the last she would feel for far too long. But where she imagined a puppy whimpering in his crate was a woman.</p><p>Her eyes we...</p></p><h2>Carson Dellosa | Skill Builders Reading Comprehension Workbook | 5th Grade, 80pgs</h2><p>Skill Builders are great tools for keeping children current during the school year or preparing them for the next grade level.

But the&nbsp;spritz is more than just an early evening cocktail&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a style&nbsp;of drinking. In Spritz, Talia Baiocchi and Leslie Pariseau trace&nbsp;the drink&#x2019;s origins to ancient Rome, uncover its unlikely history&nbsp;and culture, explore the evolution of aperitivo throughout&nbsp;Northern Italy, and document the spritz&#x2019;s revival around&nbsp;the world. From regional classics to modern variations,&nbsp;<i>Spritz</i> includes dozens of recipes from some of America&#x2019;s&nbsp;most lauded bartenders, a guide to building a spritz bar,&nbsp;and a collection of food recipes for classic Italian&nbsp;snacks to pair alongside.</p><p><b>Talia Baiocchi </b>is the editor-in-chief&nbsp;of Punch and the author of James Beard Award-nominated <i>Sherry</i>.

She has written for the <i>New York Times,&nbsp;GQ, Esquire</i>, and <i>Saveur</i>. She lives in Brooklyn.Introduction<br> The Italian word <i>sprezzatura</i> doesn&#x2019;t have an English translation. Coined in the early sixteenth century by Renaissance author Baldassare Castiglione in his <i>Book of the Courtier</i> (1528), sprezzatura implied the sort of effortless grace that royal attendants of that gilded era embodied. For Castiglione, sprezzatura was a definitive pillar of true art&#x2014;to work so hard at something that its beauty, to the beholder, appeared easy, agile, blithe. It was, in essence, the art of concealing <br> art&#x2019;s design.&nbsp;<br><br> Today the word has taken on a more colloquial meaning. It&#x2019;s often tossed around in menswear publications in reference to details of rakish sophistication&#x2014;imperfectly folded pocket squares, oxfords worn without socks, the perfect five o&#x2019;clock stubble. Although the spritz and sprezzatura are not officailly related, it&#x2019;s this I-woke-up-like-this mix of&nbsp;beauty and ease that perhaps best describes the drink.&nbsp;<br><br> This would, admittedly, be the perfect place to tell the story of our respective first spritzes, but neither of us can remember when we met the Technicolor dreamboat for the first time. It was likely during our &#x201c;formative&#x201d; drinking years, on one of a couple trips to Italy in the mid-2000s, wherein the spritz was likely shoved into an evening that very well could&#x2019;ve included everything from red wine to lighter fluid (not really, but practically)&#x2014;hence the foggy memory. <br> We do, however, remember when the drink became a part of our everyday routines, about three summers ago. Little did we know that this frivolous cocktail, seemingly built to be tossed back with abandon, had such a backstory.<br>&nbsp;<br> While the proto-spritz can be traced back to Greek and Roman times, the modern spritz has its roots&#x2014;the Italian mythos goes&#x2014;in Hapsburg-occupied northern Italy in the nineteenth century, when Austrian soldiers introduced the practice of adding a <i>spritz</i> (spray) of water to the region&#x2019;s wines, in an effort to make them more pleasing to their Riesling-weaned palates. The drink went through a number of iterations, first with the inclusion of soda water at the turn of the nineteenth century, then the addition of the all-important bitter element (which made it both undeniably Italian and a proper cocktail) in the 1920s and early 1930s, and finally the widespread addition of prosecco in the 1990s. Today, the spritz archetype is more or less a combination of three parts prosecco, two parts bitter liquer, and one part soda. And thanks to Aperol, it&#x2019;s now Italy&#x2019;s most popular cocktail.&nbsp;<br><br> But more than just the ideal combination of bubbles and bitterness in a low-alcohol package, the spritz has become a window into understanding not only the evolution of Italian cocktail culture <br> but also the importance of ritual and leisure to Italian identity.<br><br> In America, our homegrown cultural reference point for the spritz (or &#x201c;spritzer,&#x201d; as ladies of a certain generation might refer to it) is a less enchanted one. It&#x2019;s a word that, for decades, was synonymous with perms, thong leotards, Richard Simmons, salad bars, and blush wine. Born as a half-hearted diet fad in the 1980s, the white wine spritzer was the softer sister of the vodka-soda&#x2014;a monument to the era that oversaw the slow death of sophisticated flavors (and, simultaneously, many overwrought attempts at the opposite). But the current cocktail renaissance has left no stone unturned.&nbsp;<br><br> Now, in place of the spritzer, there are countless riffs on the bitter, bubbly, low-alcohol formula that has become nothing short of a phenomenon in Italy. But in true American fashion, the drink&#x2019;s blueprint has birthed an entire category of new drinks here, from those that swap in lambrusco for prosecco, tonic for soda water, sherry for white wine, and shrubs for fresh fruit. And though not always explicitly called spritzes, the low-alcohol cocktail movement, which includes classic <i>aperitivi (</i>drinks meant to open a meal, see page 14) like the Americano (page 99), coolers, and more, often carries spritzes under its own umbrellas of easygoing effervescence. Spritzes incognito, you might say.&nbsp;<br><br> With all of this avant-garde spritzing happening anew in the United States (which we&#x2019;ve explored with great vigor), we wondered what might be going on with the spritz in its spiritual home. How was it faring amidst the incredible success of the Aperol Spritz campaign, and what secrets did its stomping grounds in northern Italy still hold? It was out of a sense of duty that we went off to find the answers to these very important questions.<br> Over the course of ten days, we cut a path across northern Italy, from the many old <i>bacari</i> (wine bars)<i> </i>in Venice to the legendary Bar Basso in Milan to the old gilded caf�s of Turin. In the process, we discovered that the spritz&#x2019;s biggest secret is that it really is much more than a recipe or a category of drinks that calls for the mixing of Italian booze and wine. The spritz is a regional perspective on the aperitif&#x2014;or, as Leonardo Leuci, one of the owners of the Roman cocktail bar The Jerry Thomas Project and a leading expert on Italian cocktails, eloquently points out, &#x201c;a cultural way that certain regions in the north&#x2014;Veneto, Trentino, Friuli&#x2014;think about aperitifs.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s also a mantra, an attitude, and a state of being.&nbsp;<br><br> The spritz really is sprezzatura itself.<br> What we aim to offer you in the pages to follow is a glimpse of the spritz&#x2019;s past and present, in Italy and in the American craft cocktail bar. We also hope to translate how the spritz became so much more than a&nbsp;recipe and a marketing campaign, but part of a ritual and a means to understand an entire country&#x2019;s philosophy on socializing&#x2014;the &#x201c;spritz life,&#x201d; if you will.&nbsp;<br> And after many a golden hour spent in the north of Italy, we wanted to extend and share the ritual back home, so we&#x2019;ve provided you with all of the advice and tools to create your own aperitivo hour (Italian happy hour)&#x2014;from building your go-to spritz bar to devising the ideal snack spread to match. We&#x2019;ve created a framework of drink recipes that present the evolution of the spritz from classic to modern to the drink&#x2019;s philosophical relatives. But they are simply that: a set of little tried-and-true blueprints that are meant less as ending points than <br> as trailheads.&nbsp;<br><br> So, without further ado: spritz on.&nbsp;<br><br> It all began with the<b> </b>Greeks and Romans, naturally.&nbsp;<br><br> Back in the fourth and fifth century B.C., when Alexander III was slaying his way to &#x201c;Great&#x201d; and Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle were fathering modern philosophy, these men were also, for all intents and purposes&#x2014;proto-spritzing.&nbsp;<br><br> During the heady days of empire building, it was considered gauche to drink wine without first mixing it with water. &#x201c;Only Dionysus, they believed, could drink unmixed wine without risk,&#x201d; writes Tom Standage in <i>A History of the World in 6 Glasses</i>. Drunkenness, as it were, was not next to godliness. Thus, lengthening and diluting the concentrated wines of the day meant that you could, say, drink a pitcher of wine at the symposium without getting yourself in trouble with the symposiarch (essentially an ancient mash-up of host and chaperone).&nbsp;<br> After Rome overtook Greece as the dominant Mediterranean powerhouse in the middle of the second century B.C., many of the cultural achievements of the Greeks lived long in Roman culture, <br> not least among them the cultivation and appreciation of wine.&nbsp;<br><br> As the Italian peninsula established itself as the premier supplier of wine to the Mediterranean basin, a number of Greek wine-mixing rituals were improved upon, notably the addition of water to wine, or even seawater, as the Greek wines of Cos and Lesbos became famous for. Falernian, a white wine grown on the slopes of present-day Mount Massico near the border between Campania and Lazio, was considered the most expensive and sought-after wine in the Roman Empire, and one of the most mythologized in the history of wine. In a testament to the importance of the &#x201c;proto-spritzing&#x201d; ritual, even the oldest and most prized vintages of Falernian were mixed with water&#x2014;an act akin to dumping your water glass into a decanter full of very old, and very expensive, Montrachet.&nbsp;<br><br> Bacchus wept.&nbsp;<br> While Falernian loomed large in the Roman psyche, a number of other wines established themselves as all the rage; most notable among them (at least for our purposes) was Setine. A spritz of sorts, Setine, or Setinum, was a strong, sweet wine often diluted with snow that became the premier summer drink and a pan-seasonal favorite of Augustus, owing both to its flavor (according to the Roman poet Martial, it tasted of salty Chian figs, for what it&#x2019;s worth) and the fact that it did not cause him indigestion. Other wines, like Mulsum, which had honey added to it; Conditum, which was mixed with herbs and spices; and Rosatum, which was flavored with roses, were often consumed as aperitivi.&nbsp;<br><br> Fast forward 2,000 years, and the foundation of our modern&nbsp;notion of the aperitivo drink is being built, bar by bar, in northern Italy&#x2014;first in the northwest with vermouth in the eighteenth century, bitter liqueurs in the nineteenth century, and a combination of vermouth and bitters at the beginning of the twentieth century (hello, Americano). At the same time, the northeast is busy with its own interpretation of the archetypal aperitivo cocktail: the spritz.&nbsp;<br> Water into Wine<br><br> The word &#x201c;spritz&#x201d;&#x2014;derived from the German <i>spritzen</i>, meaning &#x201c;to spray&#x201d;&#x2014;is the first clue to the modern origins of the drink. The Italian legend is that the spritz either originated in the northeast of Italy in the nineteenth century, when the region was ruled by the Hapsburgs (centuries-strong Austro-Hungarian imperialists who had some notorious trouble with inbreeding), or during World War I, when&nbsp;Austrian soldiers were, likewise, a fixture in the region.&nbsp;<br> These folks, used to their high-acid Rieslings and Gr�ners, apparently didn&#x2019;t take to the wines of the area, the story goes, which&#x2014;depending on who you ask&#x2014;were considered either too bitter, too strong, of poor quality, or all of the above. The Austrians ultimately resorted to ordering their wine with a spritz of water to dilute it, in an unintentional nod to the ancients.&nbsp;<br> As with most Italian tales of uncertain origin, the spritz story has acquired a very Italian dose of embellishment&#x2014;including one dead-serious story a notable Italian bartender told us involving beach-going German counts and Valpolicella&#x2014;to the point of parody. Roberto Pasini, in his book on the spritz phenomenon in Italy, <i>Guida allo</i> <i>Spritz</i>, sarcastically recounts an alternative origin story wherein a bartender, outraged at the notion that his patron would ask for water in his wine, punches him in the face, causing a &#x201c;spritz&#x201d; of blood from his busted nose to splash into his glass, coloring his drink a shade of red. &#x201c;Okay, I allowed myself some license,&#x201d; he jokes, &#x201c;but I swear I based it on the most reliable historical hypotheses.&#x201d;<br><br> Whether or not the modern spritz&#x2019;s origins involve foreign soldiers with an aversion to the strength (or quality) of the wines is difficult to confirm&#x2014;and every person really will give you a different answer. What we do know is that the early spritz was simply a combination <br> of white wine and still water, � la Greek- and Roman-style.&nbsp;<br> But as far as we&#x2019;re concerned, even if the widespread practice of adding water to wine in the north of Italy&#x2014;or at least the introduction of the word &#x201c;spritz&#x201d; to define it&#x2014;does belong to the Hapsburgs, the spritz really doesn&#x2019;t become the modern spritz until it gains its now-inseparable sparkle. Or as Guido Zarri, the former owner of Select (the Venetian red bitter brand often credited as the first to be added to the spritz formula), puts it, &#x201c;the spritz is born when soda is born.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> While soda water was present in Italy by the end of the nineteenth century&#x2014;and siphons began appearing in aspirational advertisements for everything from Campari to Bitter Pastore in the first years of the twentieth century&#x2014;according to Fulvio Piccinino, a drinks historian <br> and the author of <i>La Miscelazione Futurista</i> (Futurist Mixology), it <br> only started to become a widespread fixture in bars about a decade and a half into the twentieth century.&nbsp;<br> By the late 1910s, soda water was at least popular enough that it prompted the invention of what remains one of Italy&#x2019;s most important aperitivo cocktails: the Americano, which is documented for the first&nbsp;time in Ferruccio Mazzon&#x2019;s 1920 <i>Guida al Barman</i>. During this same time, the first iteration of the modern spritz began planting its&nbsp;flag in the northeast of Italy and beyond. You could&nbsp;order the spritz<i> liscio</i> (plain) or spritz<i> bianco </i>(white)&#x2014;a simple mixture of soda water and white wine that is now known as the &#x201c;spritzer&#x201d; in the United States and Austria, <i>gespritzer</i> or <i>schorle</i> in Germany, <i>fr�ccs</i> in Hungary, <i>gemist</i> in Croatia, and so on.<br><br> This white spritz, though, is neither a cocktail (the common creed is that a cocktail is not a cocktail if it contains less than three ingredients) nor exactly Italian. Those two designations come with the addition, in the 1920s and 1930s, of what is arguably the spritz&#x2019;s most important ingredient: bitter liqueur. When it comes to the modern Italian perspective on mixed drinks (and, sidebar, fascism&#x2014;but never mind that), it&#x2019;s in this period that, according to Fulvio Piccinino, &#x201c;everything is born.&#x201d;<br> The Rise of the Italian Bitter&nbsp;<br> The production of bitter liqueurs&#x2014;wine- or spirit-based concoctions infused with bitter herbs, citrus, other ingredients, and sweeteners&#x2014;and vermouth had become a cultural imperative in Turin by the middle of the nineteenth century (and earlier, in the case of vermouth).<br> Coffee, it turned out, was&#x2014;then as it is now&#x2014;inseparable from alcohol in Italy. By 1842 Turin had around one hundred coffeehouses, or caf�s, that played host to a broad cross-section of society. Decked out in marble, gold, and glass, with preternatural lighting that seems to melt into the furnishings, the surviving caf�s (many of them beautifully preserved) exude a sort of halo effect&#x2014;as if to remove any doubt about their divinity within Italian culture. Manned by bow-tied and white-jacketed barmen, these caf�s in their original forms may have been all-business in the front, but there was very often a party in the back.&nbsp;<br> The cellars and backrooms of these caf�s became defacto labs manned by a <i>ma�tre licoriste </i>or <i>specialiare</i>&#x2014;an alcoholic alchemist of sorts tasked with, among other things, mixing formulas for bitters, both proprietary and from established recipes. It&#x2019;s here that some of the most important figures in the world of Italian drinks&#x2014;notably Gaspare Campari (of Campari) and Alessandro Martini (of Martini &amp; Rossi)&#x2014;would get their starts. And just as the seeds of the American Revolution were sown in our early taverns, the Turinese coffeehouses played host to many of the early intellectual rumblings of the <i>Risorgimento</i>, or the political movement that led to the unification of&nbsp;Italy.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Charlie Brown Christmas: Deluxe Edition (Peanuts)</h2><p><p> Celebrate Christmas with Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang in this gorgeous deluxe storybook retelling of the beloved Christmas special! </p> <p> Christmas is almost here, which means ice-skating, Christmas carols, and sparkly lights everywhere&#x2014;even on Snoopy&#x2019;s doghouse!

When I first submitted the Acts of Faith manuscript to my editor, it was on paper, delivered by snail mail. The Internet was very new, which didn&#x2019;t matter because most people did not own a computer. There was no social media to spread news or gossip. Millionaire Kylie Jenner had not yet been born, and the only way you could purchase something outside of a store was through a catalog. Today, much of what is common, normal, and accepted is very different. Still, certain elements of the human conditions remain the same. Even in today&#x2019;s fast-paced technology-driven world, there are people who do not believe they have the capacity or the power to navigate the advances taking place all around them. For more than just a few, today&#x2019;s world is an overwhelming and scary place. With great fear and trepidation, these people are just about to. Just about to break up; just about to break down; just about to make some money; just about to declare bankruptcy. Very often, when these folks are just about to do something, they encounter something that takes them off track. They blame that something for their lack of faith in themselves and the process of life.<br> <br>There are other people who skip through life almost-ing. I almost had this; I almost did that. These are usually the same people who almost didn&#x2019;t do something but are now just about to do something else. Looking at them and the situations many of them wrestle with, you pray that they do something, anything to move themselves in a new direction. What you may not understand or recognize is that there is a secret thrill and excitement that goes along with just about to do and almost did that keeps people stuck in a time warp of fear and faithlessness. There is no amount of likes or follows that will convince them that they or life can be different. They are content to talk about rather than be about something different. Change takes place in the moment, and when you have faith, any moment can be the moment that change happens for you. Without faith, you will live in a scary place. For clarity&#x2019;s sake, let&#x2019;s call that place on the edge.<br> <br>The edge is the place you live in when you almost do what you know you need to do, but don&#x2019;t follow through for one reason or another. The edge is where you live when you hope, wish, and try, but never seem able to get anything done. The edge is where you live when you view yourself as a victim of the circumstances of your life, with no real clue about how you are creating our experiences. It is also on the edge where you can develop the faith you need to do what is required to abandon the edge forever.<br> <br>Twenty-five years ago, when this book first appeared, patterns of belief and behavior were breaking down because they no long fit the times in which we were living. Back then when a postage stamp cost 25 cents, people could not imagine that the ATM would make a difference in the lives of ordinary people. When a gallon of gas was 97 cents, people believed that a low-fat diet with lots of carbs was the key to losing weight. When gangsta rap was growing as a recognized form of social and political expression, public discussions of spirituality outside of the church were feared and denounced. In response to these changes, people&#x2019;s stress levels were increasing. Most people needed a little help to get them off the edge of changing times and mind-sets. They were willing to consider something new and different that gave them a sense of empowerment. In the pages of a little purple book, I offered them something to consider. I offered them faith. Faith in themselves. Faith in the changes taking place in the world. Faith in the processes of life that at the time looked and felt very strange. Since that time, more than six million people have used the messages in this book to renew themselves and their faith. But again today we find ourselves on the edge, being motivated to find and embrace a more centered, loving, and peaceful approach to the changes we encounter. At the same time, there are many who are scratching their heads in amazement or shaking with fear, wondering if they are going to make it through the rapid changes with which we are being confronted.<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s be honest! There&#x2019;s a certain thrill that comes with living on the edge. There is a thrill that accompanies the struggle to hang on. There&#x2019;s a certain thrill people get from the urgency of holding things together or keeping them from falling apart. People who live on the edge can become so addicted to the adrenaline rush of the drama that they depend on crises to make them feel important. When you are struggling on the edge, you have something to do. When there is a problem to solve or a crisis to overcome, you feel needed. When you make desperate attempts to overcome the problems and difficulties you face, you feel validated. This gives you a temporary high called busyness. For some people, being busy makes life worth living. People who live on the edge are always busy avoiding something, getting over something or getting through one thing or another. In most cases, they never quite make it over to the other side, but they can tell exciting stories about the struggle just to hang on.<br> <br>I grew up on the edge. I became master at hanging out on the edge by watching the adults in my life move through just about to dramas, almost disasters. I can&#x2019;t even count the number of times I heard one of my relatives say, &#x201c;I almost had a disaster on my hands.&#x201d; For most of my young adult life, I lived on the edge of poverty or the edge of financial breakthrough. I lived right on the edge of almost getting my life in order, while at the same time being on the edge of having my life fall apart. I lived on the edge of my relationships breaking up while doing everything I could to keep myself from breaking down. I learned how to survive being on the edge by pumping myself up with victory chants: &#x201c;This is not going to happen to me&#x2014;again!&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna make it through this!&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not about to let this get me down!&#x201d; I had a lot of company on the edge. Friends who knew about my situation because of their own situation cheered me on. We supported one another through our edge-of-night and edge-of-daylight dilemmas. We compared notes on how close we were to falling off the edge, each one of us quietly taking pride in the fact that there was someone closer to falling off than we were. Living on the edge ultimately becomes a way of life, simply because it is what you know. More often, you stay there because you don&#x2019;t believe you deserve better, and because you lack the faith required to have more.<br> <br>Some of us live on the edge because we are undisciplined. Others of us are there because we simply don&#x2019;t know any better way. We live on the edge because it attracts attention, gives us an excuse; as long as we are hanging on at the edge, we cannot be held responsible for ourselves, our lives or the way things turn out. After all, when you are on the edge, you could be pushed over; you could slip and fall; you could hang off the edge until you lose your grip; but whatever way it happens, should you fall off the edge, it would not be your fault. You did the best you could because when you are on the edge, just about to or almost-ing, life happened to you, not through you. When life is happening to you, it is almost impossible to focus faithfully on anything good.<br> <br>When you live on the edge, you do not plan, because you need faith to plan. You have no faith, so you wish, hope, and try. You hope things will work out. You try to do better. When things don&#x2019;t work out or when you don&#x2019;t get what you are trying to get, you get busy trying to make things happen. But when you live on the edge, you expect the worst. You look for the worst anywhere and you see it everywhere. In reality, though, you have very limited vision. It takes faith and courage to see beyond your present circumstances into the divine opportunities and possibilities of the future. Trying to make things happen keeps you on the edge, whereas faith can and will catapult you into a breakthrough.<br> <br>Day by day, step by step, a little at a time&#x2014;that is how faith works. Quite often when I read my mail, I am stunned by the anguish, fear, frustration, and sometimes desperation with which people write. More than a few describe the feeling of being overwhelmed. They do not understand why things are not going better in their lives or in the world. Painfully they describe to me their meditation and prayer practices. They affirm forgiveness of themselves and others. They claim to be working diligently to overcome their own shortcomings and challenges. Yet for some reason the bills still aren&#x2019;t paid or the relationship doesn&#x2019;t seem to be getting better; there is no relationship prospect in sight and the business still isn&#x2019;t booming. More important, when the feelings of frustration get the best of the best of them, they ask me: &#x201c;What am I doing wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>For those who may feel they are on the edge, rest assured, you are not doing anything wrong. Everything is exactly as it should be. There is no amount of meditation, prayer, silence, or any other spiritual practice that will change the circumstances of your life overnight. The purpose of all spiritual practice is to change your consciousness&#x2014;how you see things; what you care about; how you approach whatever it is that confronts you. Day by day, prayer will elevate the heart and mind above and beyond the physical realities of life. Step by step, meditation will take you into a deeper realization of truth, enabling you to act in ways that will alter the physical makeup of your life. Little by little, your thoughts and feelings will be transformed, and your consciousness will follow suit. When this happens, life takes on an entirely different meaning and perspective. You are not doing anything wrong. You are being transformed day by day, step by step, a little at a time, because that is how faith works in, through, and for us. In the pages of this book, I am offering you the opportunity to get off the edge by doing a little each day to transform how you see yourself, like our ever-changing world. Which, by the way, is exactly what I did twenty-five years ago when this book was first presented.<br> <br>Today, as we move into yet another new time, a new frontier, the new and fast-paced energy of an ever-changing world, it is our spiritual responsibility to seek, find, know, and embrace truth, not just facts. Facts are the physical manifestation of data, but truth is the immutable impersonal laws of the universe into which we invest our faith. As we embrace the truth with faith, we shall be emancipated from all manner of bondage in our minds, hearts, lives, and souls. Toward that end, I am offering what I call the Twelve Commitments of Faith, which will be reinforced by the daily messages you will find in this book.<br> <br>Thou shalt be committed to . . .<br> <br>� Standing proudly and boldly, demonstrating your authentic and unique self without defending or diminishing who you are to others.<br> <br>� Speaking the truth of your heart and experience in a loving manner, holding on to that truth even when no one else agrees with you.<br> <br>� Making peace your priority, endeavoring to be kind and loving to all people, even difficult people, who are anything but peaceful, kind and loving.<br> <br>� Giving yourself permission to make mistakes by believing and trusting that the universe will give you an endless supply of do-overs.<br> <br>� Forgiving yourself and others daily, even when it is hard, more specifically when you absolutely don&#x2019;t want to do it.<br> <br>� Refraining from thinking, saying, and doing anything that does not bring you peace or joy.<br> <br>� Demonstrating respect for all people&#x2019;s beliefs, particularly those that are different from yours.<br> <br>� Demonstrating and remembering that you matter.<br> <br>� Honoring and taking care of Mother Earth.<br> <br>� Balancing your life with work that you love, play that is fun, rest of mind and body, and service to others without expectation of reward or recognition.<br> <br>� Securing the children first.<br> <br>� Remembering that each of these things brings both tangible and intangible benefits into your mind, heart, and life when you place your faith in doing them consistently.<br> <br>If you will commit to faithfully reading one page of this book every day for one year, you will experience a shift in your consciousness that can change your life. If you go one step further by reading, answering, and practicing the reflections offered at the end of each day&#x2019;s reading, your mind, your heart, and your life will change. While I can honestly say there are no guarantees in life, I can also say that when you elevate your consciousness, faith unfolds naturally. When you are faith-filled and faithful, trust grows. When you faithfully trust yourself and the process of life, you see things change. They just do.<br> <br>I know what it feels like to lose faith. I lost faith in myself, life, and God when I lost my daughter Gemmia. I almost gave up. I was holding a pearl-handled pistol in my hand ready to end my life. Suddenly, as if someone was sitting next to me, I heard, &#x201c;Stop being dramatic!&#x201d; In that instant, I remembered the message I had written for July 15 in this book: People come into your life for a reason, a season, and a lifetime. Gemmia&#x2019;s season in life, in my life, and on this earth had come to an end. Ours would continue to be a lifetime relationship, even though she was now in spirit. I remembered how I had struggled as a young mother trying to find myself and maintain stability for my children. Neither Gemmia nor her brother and sister ever gave up on me. They trusted me as their mother. They hung in there with me while I danced around the edges of my life. It became clear to me that I did not have the right to give up on myself or on life. I put the pistol back in the box and placed the box back on the top shelf of the closet. Moment by moment I called in the faith and strength I needed to live beyond the loss of my baby girl, my best friend. Day by day I garnered the faith to know and then to believe that the pain of the loss would end. Step by step I remembered who I was, what I believed in, and everything Gemmia would have said to me about being faithful and trusting God and myself and the process of life. Today my faith is stronger than it has ever been, and I am at peace. I now know that the experiences we face each day are designed for us to test us and help us grow in faith.<br> <br>I invite you to join me on a faith-building journey through the pages of this book. Let us set an intention to change how we see ourselves and one another, using faith as our looking glass. I encourage you to use faith as the foundation for creating and attracting more peace, joy, love, and abundance in every area of your life. Yes, things have changed over the past twenty-five years; however, there is a truth that has remained constant. That is, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen. My prayer is that together we can transform our hopes, dreams, and visions into reality by being faithfully committed to transforming what we think, how we speak, and what we do day by day, step by step, act of faith by act of faith. And now we shall begin.</p><h2>BOB Books: Developing Readers Workbook</h2><p>Don't miss the companion workbook to the bestselling learn-to-read boxed sets!

The day he lured me into his office-which was also the first day we met-he proposed. You&#39;d think a guy who looked like him-a bit cold maybe, but still striking and very unattainable-would only ask the love of his life to marry him, right? You&#39;d think he must be madly in love.Nope. It was me he asked. A complete stranger who had never even heard of him. A stranger who had been dumped by her fianc� only weeks before. You&#39;d think I&#39;d laugh in his face, call him insane-and a few other names-then walk away as quickly as possible. Well...I did all those things except the walking away part.It took him only minutes to talk me into a business deal...erm, I mean marriage, and only days for us to officially tie the knot. Happiest day of my life. Magical. Pop the champagne... Not. It was the worst day. Jack Hawthorne was nothing like what I&#39;d imagined for myself.I blamed him for my lapse in judgment.I blamed his eyes, the ocean blue eyes that looked straight into mine unapologetically, and that frown on his face I had no idea I would become so fascinated with in time.It wasn&#39;t long after he said I was the biggest mistake of his life that things started to change. No, he still didn&#39;t talk much, but anyone can string a few words together. His actions spoke the loudest to me. And day after day my heart started to get a mind of its own.One second he was no one. The next he became everything.One second he was unattainable. The next he seemed to be completely mine.One second I thought we were in love. The next it was still nothing but a lie.After all, I was Rose and he was Jack. We were doomed from the very beginning with those names.

He might get lost." But the illustration shows Dad closing the trunk with the pet inside, so Fly Guy accompanies them to the beach, art museum, and amusement park.

For years, he'd dreamed about making a new kind of ramen noodle soup that was quick, convenient, and tasty for the hungry people he'd seen in line for a bowl on the black market following World War II. <i>Peace follows from a full stomach,</i> he believed.<br><br>Day after day, Ando experimented. Night after night, he failed. But Ando kept experimenting.<br><br>With persistence, creativity, and a little inspiration, Ando succeeded. This is the true story behind one of the world's most popular foods.</p><p>Andrea Wang loves noodles, food, and noodling about food. A former environmental scientist, she appreciates Ando's scientific spirit, persistence in the face of failure, and passion for making the world a better place. Andrea lives in Colorado with her family and their dog, Mochi. Sometimes they have instant ramen for breakfast. You can find out more about Andrea at andreaywang.com.<br><br>Kana Urbanowicz works mainly as an illustrator and likes to draw people eating delicious food. Apart from illustration, she also creates animations, comics, and even clay figurines. She lives in Kanagawa, Japan, with her artist husband. By a lucky coincidence, there is a Momofuku Ando museum nearby, so she went there for some inspiration and noodle fun. After reading Ando's biography, Kana is happy that she could take part in making this book happen! Read more about her works at tekumushi.com.K-Gr 3&#x2014;When Momofuku Ando sees long lines of people waiting for food near his home in Osaka, Japan, shortly after World War II, his dream is born: to create the perfect bowl of noodles to feed hungry communities around the world. Realizing that "the world is peaceful only when everyone has enough to eat," he spends months testing recipes for the ideal noodle soup: tasty, perfectly seasoned, comforting, and preparable "anytime, anywhere." Each attempt at the perfect bowl of soup yields a different result: noodles that are too soggy, too brittle, or too soft. Despite personal and financial setbacks, he keeps the needs of the hungry and disenfranchised always at the center of his mission as he aims to maximize nutrition and nourishment. After trying and failing several times over, his "magic ramen" recipe is finally born: a perfectly fried noodle-broth combination that can be made in minutes by simply adding water. His invention is a success, making ramen a worldwide sensation and recognized household favorite. The author's tribute to one of history's most important inventors is complemented by digital illustrations, which separate well-paced text and add strong visual appeal to this exceptional biography picture book. An afterword is provided, giving readers additional insight into Ando's life and legacy and its connection to food history and popular culture, especially the creation of the widely recognizable Cup Noodles. VERDICT An inspiring story of persistence and an ideal purchase for any collection.&#x2013;Natalie Romano, Denver Public Library</p><h2>100 Days of Grace &amp; Gratitude: A Devotional Journal</h2><p>In today's fast-paced world and demanding and confusing times, it's easy to forget God's goodness and grace. <br><br>Bible journaling expert and author, Shanna Noel invites you to take a moment in your busy day to remember and reflect on God's promises, His goodness and His grace in this creative, thoughtful devotional journal.

"Not me!" says Froggy, and together they leapfrog to the bus stop -- flop flop flop. Froggy's exuberant antics will delight his many fans and reassure them that school can be fun."This is a great read-aloud with sounds and words that encourage active participation....A charming story to calm those pre-school jitters." -- <i>School Library JournalJonathan London is the author of many books for children, including <i>I See the Moon and the Moon Sees Me, Like Butter on Pancakes</i> and four other books about Froggy. </i></p><p>Is Froggy nervous about the first day of school? Well, just a little. First he has a terrible nightmare, dreaming that he almost misses the bus and shows up at school in his underwear. Then when he does wake up, he drops the milk just as he's about to pour some on his bowl of flies! Finally Froggy makes it out the door, leapfrogging the whole way, eager for all the challenges that await him in this comical, brightly illustrated tale of a daunting-but-rewarding first day at school.<p> Terrific for reading aloud, this is another winner in the <i>Froggy</i> series--including <i>Froggy Gets Dressed</i>, <i>Froggy Learns to Swim</i>, and <i>Froggy Plays Soccer</i>. <i>Zip, zoop, zup</i> are the sounds of Froggy getting dressed, and when he has to go somewhere, it's <i>flop, flop, flop</i> all the way. Our 5-year-old assistant reviewer had fun imitating Froggy and friends, shouting out "Frrrooggyy!" and "Wha-a-a-a-t?" at all the appropriate times. Kids will relate to the trials of the good-natured amphibian who makes lots of mistakes--he yells too loud, interrupts, and has trouble paying attention. With the support of his gentle teacher, however, he soon gets the hang of things. Before long, funny Froggy has the class, and the principal, laughing and singing along with him. All in all, he has a successful day--until he comes home to discover he's left his lunch box and cap at school! "Oh, Froggy. Will you ever learn?" said his mother. "That's why I'm going to school, Mom!" Froggy replies, with a big hop and a grin.

As these sheets traveled, they caused enormous changes in the Earth's landscape and climate, leading to the evolution of creatures such as &nbsp;giant armadillos, saber-toothed cats, and woolly mammoths as well as club-wielding Neanderthals and later the cleverer modern humans. Nico Medina re-creates this harsh ancient world in a vivid and easy-to-read narrative.</p><p>Nico Medina is the author of <i>Where Is Mount Everest?</i> and <i>Where Is the Great Barrier Reef?</i> and other books in the <i>Who Was?</i> series.<b>What Was the Ice Age?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Southwest France, September 1940<br> &nbsp;<br> Eighteen-year-old Marcel Ravidat is exploring the forest outside his village with three friends. People say there is a secret underground passage in these woods that leads to a nearby castle. <br> &nbsp;<br> The four teenagers spot a small opening in the ground. Could this be the way to the castle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or to buried treasure?<br> &nbsp;<br> Marcel is the first to lower himself into the dark. The fifty-foot passage is long and narrow. Marcel is terrified. When he reaches the bottom, he sees that he is inside an enormous cave. But it is too dark to see much else.<br> &nbsp;<br> So Marcel climbs back up. The next day he returns to the cave with his friends. This time he has a grease gun to use as a torch.<br> &nbsp;<br> Back in the cave, what the boys see amazes them. All over the curving cave walls are hundreds of colorful paintings of prehistoric beasts. The animals almost seem to come to life in the flickering light! <br> &nbsp;<br> Sixty horses gallop along the cave walls. Red deer swim across a river. Shaggy-haired rhinos thrust their sharp horns in the air. Some of these paintings are huge. One of a giant ox measures eighteen feet across! <br> &nbsp;<br> A lone human figure, wearing a bird mask, appears on the wall. He is being charged by a bison. The animal is injured. A spear is stuck in&nbsp; its belly. Its guts are spilling out!<br> &nbsp;<br> The boys can&#x2019;t believe their eyes. They are gazing at scenes from a long-lost world. What they&#x2019;ve discovered is far more interesting than some old castle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today scientists know that these cave walls at Lascaux (say: law-SKO) were painted by humans living 17,000 years ago. These artists lived during a very cold period of Earth&#x2019;s history: the Ice Age.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the Ice Age, great sheets of ice covered much of Europe, Asia, and North America. People took shelter in caves for warmth. (That is where the term caveman came from.) Animals like bears, lions, and hyenas also lived in caves, so house hunting was a deadly affair!<br> &nbsp;<br> People&#x2019;s chances of staying alive depended on their ability to adapt&#x2014;to learn how to survive in a world of fearsome predators and wild weather.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Ice Age was certainly a difficult and dangerous time to be alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1: An Ice-Covered World</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> Less than two hundred years ago, no one knew there had been an Ice Age. Then in 1837, a young Swiss professor named Louis Agassiz (say: LOO-ee AG-uh-see) gave a speech to a group of scientists. What he told the audience shocked them. <br> &nbsp;<br> Europe&#x2014;and much of the world, he said&#x2014;was once completely covered in ice! He said that this sheet of ice stretched from the North Pole to the Mediterranean Sea. The whole European continent was frozen beneath it.<br> &nbsp;<br> This age of ice was so cold, Louis said, it wiped out all life on Earth. In his book Studies on Glaciers, Louis said that &#x201c;springs dried up, streams ceased to flow, and the rays of the sun, rising over this frozen shore&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were greeted only by the whistling of the northern wind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. across the surface of the huge ocean of ice.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Louis was right. Mostly.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ice hadn&#x2019;t reached as far as the Mediterranean. And many creatures&#x2014;humans among them&#x2014;did survive the Ice Age. But Louis was on the right track.<br> &nbsp;<br> How&#x2019;d he come up with this idea?<br> &nbsp;<br> Believe it or not, it was by looking at some rocks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Louis went to the Alps in the summer of 1836. The Alps are tall mountains in central Europe. So tall, there are always glaciers&#x2014;large bodies of ice&#x2014;on their mountaintops. <br> &nbsp;<br> Louis Agassiz stayed at the home of Jean de Charpentier (say: ZHON duh Shar-pahn-tee-AY). Jean was a geologist, someone who studies rocks to learn about Earth&#x2019;s past.<br> &nbsp;<br> One day, Jean pointed out some boulders in the mountains. (Boulders are very large rocks.) The boulders didn&#x2019;t look like they had come off the mountains that surrounded them. They seemed to be made of a different kind of rock.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jean told Louis he knew why this was. Glaciers had put them there, Jean said. Long ago, when the mountain glaciers were growing, they picked up the boulders from someplace else. The moving ice dragged the boulders along. This made deep scratches in the mountainsides. Jean showed these marks to Louis, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> In time, as the ice melted away and the glaciers became smaller, the boulders stayed where the glaciers had dropped them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Louis had seen boulders like these before, standing alone in fields. He had never paid them much attention. However, when Louis returned home from his trip to Jean&#x2019;s, he began to notice boulders all around him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Louis was sure Jean was right. These boulders were proof that glaciers had once covered the area.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Louis took things one step further. If glaciers were once bigger in the Alps, couldn&#x2019;t they have been bigger around the rest of the world, too? The next year, Louis gave his famous Ice Age speech.<br> &nbsp;<br> What did Jean think about all of this? He was surprised. Jean didn&#x2019;t think Louis had the proof for these new ideas.<br> &nbsp;<br> For other people, it wasn&#x2019;t a matter of science. The notion of an Ice Age went against their belief in God and the Bible. The boulders weren&#x2019;t moved by an ancient ice sheet, they said. The boulders were carried by water. Water from a powerful flood that had covered the earth 5,000 years before. The story of this flood was told in the Bible.<br> &nbsp;<br> Louis disagreed. The boulders were way too heavy to be moved by water. It had to be ice, he said!<br> &nbsp;<br> Talk of the Ice Age spread across Europe. In England, there was a great interest in geology. Thousands of people&#x2014;not just scientists&#x2014;gathered in university halls to hear geologists speak about their discoveries. <br> &nbsp;<br> The best part of geology was that almost anyone could contribute to the science. They just had to go out in the country, write about what they saw, and collect samples. Louis always had encouraged his students to &#x201c;study nature, not books.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So that was what ordinary people started doing, too! And what they saw was more proof of an Ice Age. Scratch marks on mountainsides. Huge rocks standing in fields, as if dropped by giants. Smooth sheets of rock, polished by the moving ice. Rocks, pebbles, and other debris (called glacial drift) where glaciers had stopped growing and begun to melt. <br> &nbsp;<br> They drew maps with this information. Forty years after Louis&#x2019;s speech, a world map of Ice Age glaciers had been pieced together. It showed that places like Seattle, Washington, and New York City were once under ice!<br> &nbsp;<br> Though it had taken years, the world was beginning to believe Louis Agassiz!<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, simply knowing that there had been an Ice Age didn&#x2019;t explain what had caused the world to cool. Nor was there any understanding of when the Ice Age began. Or how long it lasted. Nevertheless, the rush to unlock the Ice Age&#x2019;s secrets had begun.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s A Day at the Police Station (Look-Look)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s time for a ride-along with Busytown&#x2019;s favorite police officer, Sergeant Murphy!

She has traveled the world in search of calm forests and beautiful peaks, and found them a&#39;plenty. When she is not hiking and climbing, she is a children&#39;s book editor in New York.Just when I am crouching over the boiling pot, calculating the last nuggets of food in my pack, I hear it. A growl in the shadows.<br><br>My heart slams into my throat. <br><br>Bear. <br><br>I've been so busy thinking about the little things, that I lost sight of the big ones. A bear is a big thing. And not a good one.<br><br>I am alone, with only a Swiss army knife for protection. And I'm pretty sure a two-inch blade covered in last night's cheese crumbs won't stop much of anything. But I slide the knife out of my back pocket anyway and point it out ahead of me, jabbing at the night. <br><br>The growl gets louder. It's coming from a choked tangle of bushes fifty feet from my campsite. In the thickening darkness I can't see when it might attack.<br><br>I think I read somewhere that if you see a black bear, you shouldn't run away or they'll think you're prey. You're supposed to look big and make loud noises. So I stand up slowly. I open my mouth to shout at it.<br><br>Nothing comes out.<br><br>I also read somewhere that animals can see and smell fear, which is really too bad because I'm trembling all over and I can feel myself breaking into a cold sweat. Look big, I tell myself again. Be brave. But then my mind empties out and I'm just praying please don't eat me, please don't eat me. <br><br>Bristling fur. Sharp teeth. Snarling lips. I cry out as it comes hurtling out of the bushes like a burst of crackling gunfire and -- it's a dog. Shaggy faced and flop eared, eyes brave with desperation. Pitch black except for a hollowed-out chest that's so mud-spattered, I can't tell if it's brown or white. A tail bent at the tip, as though someone had tried to snap it in half. It's definitely a mutt. Mangy and starving and as ugly as sin. I can count his ribs.<br><br>The dog rushes at me but I feel my heart start beating again. I leap back out of his way as he stalks over to my cook site. A swift kick with his hind leg upsets my dinner pot. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I shout, but it's too late. Spaghetti and foaming starchy water spill to the ground. The movement was practiced, smooth. This dog has done this before. He grabs a mouthful of scorching noodles and beats it back to the bushes.<br><br>I have never seen a dog hold boiling food in its mouth. The rest of my fear melts away. It must be near crazy with hunger. I wonder how long it has been out here, scavenging for scraps from frightened hikers. <br><br>I stare at the remaining spaghetti lying in the dirt. My dinner. My stomach growls angrily. I can try and salvage the remains, give the noodles a long rinse and hope the tomato sauce covers up any grit that might remain.<br><br>I sigh. Instead, I dig a fork out of my mess kit and scoop the muddy spaghetti into my pot. I tiptoe over to the edge of the campsite and dump the contents on the ground. I can see the dog now. He's twenty feet away, behind the thickest part of the bushes. He watches me with uncertain eyes.<br><br>I back up slowly. The dog does not budge until I have retreated all the way to the tent. Then it shuffles forward and begins gulping down the rest of its dinner.<br><br>&#x201c;Enjoy it,&#x201d; I tell him. I'm still annoyed, but at least he seems to appreciate my cooking.<br><br>Digging into my pack, I pull out a flattened peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It was going to be my lunch for tomorrow, but it will have to do for tonight. As the dog busies himself with my pasta, I crawl into the tent, where I spend the last minutes before true dark with the taste of cold sandwich in my mouth and the certainty that tomorrow, I'm going to have to find more food.</p><h2>Love Like You&#39;ve Never Been Hurt: Hope, Healing and the Power of an Open Heart</h2><p>It's no secret that those closest to us can wound us the most profoundly.

In the world of interior design, Nancy Braithwaite is known for her single-minded devotion to the principle that has guided her work for more than forty years: simplicity. Braithwaite&#x2019;s work is luxuriously minimalist, its beauty inextricably tied to its Shaker-like purity. While her work varies from art deco to country, the underlying rules remain the same: every element should strive to be simple and powerful without compromise, and every room must have a level of power that comes from commanding scale, repetition of elements, subtleties of color, or the sheer beauty of forms. In Braithwaite&#x2019;s world, excess is not opulent. Simplicity is opulent. Braithwaite takes the reader deep into her singular vision. Divided into five sections, the book begins with her manifesto on simplicity and the aspects of design used to achieve it, including architecture, scale, color, texture, pattern, and composition. She then presents three categories of style&#x2014;country, classic, and contemporary&#x2014;and explains and illustrates each with iconic rooms from her portfolio.

In <i>Sonic and The Tales of Deception</i>, Sonic and his friends save the world from Dr. Eggman and his cronies in three original stories. This set of short stories with full color illustrations is the perfect introduction to one of the most beloved video game characters of all time and a must-have title for long-time fans eager for new content!</p><p>Jake Black lives in a small Utah town with his wife and children. He is the author of numerous titles for Penguin Young Readers, including <i>Tales from Regular Show</i>, <i>What In the Universe?</i> and <i>Best Buds Together Fun</i>.WHAM! Another robot slammed into the wall, breaking into two, now inanimate, pieces of junk metal. Sonic turned around to see that it was Knuckles who had stopped the robot right before it had reached him. He gave him a quick nod as they both kept fighting and shouted, &#x201c;Thanks. That was a close one!&#x201d;<br><br> The day began like any other day. Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy Rose learned that a small army of Dr. Eggman&#x2019;s robots had descended on the city and were wreaking havoc everywhere. As usual, the team raced to the scene and leaped into action. Sonic sped up and down buildings, leaping off them, smashing through the outer shells of robot after robot. Tails weaved his plane in and around the cityscape, blasting robots into oblivion. Knuckles and Amy Rose used their strength and fighting skills to dominate several other robots. It almost seemed too easy. And perhaps it was.<br><br> Not far from the scene of the battle, Dr. Eggman observed the fight between his creations and Team Sonic from a floating platform. Smiling, he pulled a small remote control from his pocket. He pressed a small button on the side of the remote. Suddenly, from beneath the platform, a swarm of what appeared to be bees formed a cloud around Eggman.<br><br> &#x201c;Finally! My ultimate plan has come to pass! These robot bee stings will inject Sonic with tiny nanobots that will take over his cellular structure and turn him into a robot&#x2014;a robot that I can control!&#x201d; Eggman said and laughed. &#x201c;Fly, my pretties!&#x201d;<br><br> The swarm drifted high into the air and began the flight toward Sonic and his friends in the city.<br><br> Unaware of the oncoming cloud of robot bees, Sonic stood with his friends in the middle of the carnage, and smashed and shattered the remains of the evil robots surrounding them.<br><br> &#x201c;Nothing like totally winning another fight with Eggman&#x2019;s loser &#x2019;bots!&#x201d; Sonic said, his friends laughing.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Sonic,&#x201d; Amy Rose giggled, &#x201c;you were amazing, as always.&#x201d;<br><br> Tails and Knuckles rolled their eyes at each other.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I was!&#x201d; Sonic said.<br><br> &#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; Knuckles said. &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t&#x2019;ve done it without us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Could so!&#x201d; Sonic replied, pretending to be offended by his friend&#x2019;s words.<br><br> &#x201c;What I don&#x2019;t totally understand, is why it was so easy to beat these robots. Something&#x2019;s up,&#x201d; Tails said, sounding unusually worried.<br><br> &#x201c;Easy?! There were like a million robots. That wasn&#x2019;t easy!&#x201d; Knuckles protested.<br><br> &#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Sonic said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost like it was supposed to be a distraction. Eggman&#x2019;s up to some&#x2014;&#x201d; Tails raised his hand. &#x201c;Shhh. What&#x2019;s that noise?&#x201d; he asked. The group went silent. In the distance, they heard a humming noise. It grew louder and louder. The sky darkened as the cloud of bees shrouded the sun.<br><br> &#x201c;What . . . what is that?&#x201d; Amy Rose asked, her voice quivering.<br><br> &#x201c;Eggman&#x2019;s distraction,&#x201d; Sonic said.<br><br> The cloud of robot bees shrunk and morphed into an almost-solid cube. The cube picked up speed as it hurled toward Sonic. The speedy hedgehog was poised to strike. Just as he was about to run toward the cube, the cube exploded into a spherical swarm. Each of the thousands of robot bees pointed their stingers toward Sonic and were moving down on top of him in sphere formation. Sonic&#x2019;s eyes grew wide. He&#x2019;d never seen anything like it before. Paralyzed in wonder, Sonic could only stare as the bees moved faster and closer to him.<br><br> &#x201c;Sonic! Move!&#x201d; Tails yelled. But it was no use, Sonic was hypnotized by the bees.<br><br> Knuckles jumped into action. The red echidna climbed rapidly up the wall of a nearby building and sprang off toward Sonic. The bees were getting close, only inches from Sonic.<br> Knuckles collided with Sonic, slamming the hedgehog to the ground and out of the bees&#x2019; path, snapping him out of his hypnotic trance. Sonic stood just in time to see the sphere of bees cover Knuckles, stinging him all over his body.<br><br> Seconds later, the bees regrouped as the cube and flew away, high into the sky. Sonic, Tails, and Amy Rose stood over Knuckles.<br><br> &#x201c;Uggghhhh . . . what . . . happened?&#x201d; Knuckles managed to say as he moaned. &#x201c;I . . . I don&#x2019;t . . . I don&#x2019;t feel right.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to get him back to my lab,&#x201d; Tails said urgently.<br><br> Back in Tails&#x2019; lab, Knuckles was flat on his back and connected to several different machines. The brilliant fox was examining a strange spot on Knuckles&#x2019; arm.<br><br> &#x201c;Guys, come check this out,&#x201d; Tails said. Sonic and Amy Rose joined him, peering at the weird metallic spot that was slowly growing on Knuckles&#x2019; arm.<br><br> &#x201c;I think those bees are turning Knuckles into a robot,&#x201d; Tails said matter-of-factly.<br> &#x201c;How is that possible?&#x201d; Amy Rose asked.<br><br> Sonic turned away, angrily. &#x201c;Eggman. He has to be behind this. Those robots we beat <i>were</i> a distraction, like we thought&#x2014;a distraction so those bees could sting me and turn me into a robot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Tails said. &#x201c;I think those bees&#x2019; stingers injected Knuckles with microscopic robots&#x2014;nanobots&#x2014;that are rewriting his body and turning him into a robot.&#x201d;<br><br> Amy Rose teared up. &#x201c;Is there anything we can do?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We have one shot, but it&#x2019;s a long one,&#x201d; Tails said. &#x201c;We have to get inside Knuckles and destroy the nanobots that have started to take over his body.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Inside?&#x201d; Amy Rose asked, confused.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Tails replied, walking across the lab to a large machine topped by a laser. &#x201c;We can use the Super Shrink Ray and enter his body through that robotic spot on his arm.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going in,&#x201d; Sonic said.<br><br> &#x201c;I thought you might say that,&#x201d; Tails said. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I think: It looks like the nanobots are just like any other beehive. They have a &#x2018;queen&#x2019; that&#x2019;s controlling them. Plus, I think they&#x2019;re self-replicating or something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyways, they have orders from the queen to complete their task, so they will not stop until they do.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Or until I defeat the queen,&#x201d; Sonic said.<br><br> &#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Tails.<br><br> &#x201c;Knock out the hive. Got it. Where&#x2019;s the queen gonna be so I can kick her tail?&#x201d; Sonic asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know exactly, but I bet she&#x2019;s inside Knuckles&#x2019; brain,&#x201d; Tails said.<br><br> Sonic nodded.&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this,&#x201d; he said.</p><h2>Spectrum Math Word Problems Grade 2, Ages 7 to 8, 2nd Grade Math Word Problems, Addition, Subtraction, Reading, and Writing Numbers to 100, Multi-Step ...

But it is also an ancient book about people and cultures very different than us. Thus, while we know we should read it, many of us have a hard time understanding the Bible. In this expanded edition of <em>Knowing Scripture,</em> R. C. Sproul helps us dig out the meaning of Scripture for ourselves. The author says, "The theme of this book is not how to <em>read</em> the Bible but how to <em>study</em> the Bible." He presents in simple, basic terms a commonsense approach to studying Scripture and gives eleven practical guidelines for biblical interpretation and applying what we learn. With a minimum of technical jargon, Sproul tackles some of the knotty questions regarding differences of interpreting the Bible, including <ul><li>discovering the meanings of biblical words</li><li>understanding Hebrew poetry, proverbs and parables</li><li>approaching historical and didactic passages</li><li>being careful with predictive prophecy</li><li>discerning how culture conditions the Bible</li><li>choosing and using Bible translations, commentaries, Bible software and other helps</li></ul> Now with a new preface, <em>Knowing Scripture</em> is a basic book for both beginning Bible readers and experienced students of Scripture.</p><p>R.C. Sproul (1939&#x2013;2017) was founder Ligonier Ministries, an international Christian discipleship organization located near Orlando, Florida. He was also copastor of Saint Andrew's Chapel in Sanford, Florida, first president of Reformation Bible College, and executive editor of <em>Tabletalk</em> magazine. His radio program, <em>Renewing Your Mind,</em> is still broadcast daily on hundreds of radio stations around the world and can also be heard online. Sproul contributed dozens of articles to national evangelical publications, spoke at conferences, churches, and schools around the world, and wrote more than one hundred books, including <em>The Holiness of God, Chosen by God, </em>and <em>Everyone's a Theologian.</em> He also served as general editor of the <em>Reformation Study Bible</em>.<br><br>J. I. Packer is regarded as one of the most influential evangelicals in North America. He is Board of Governors' Professor of Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, and his writings include books such as <em>Knowing God</em>, <em>A Quest for Godliness</em>, <em>Growing in Christ</em> (Crossway) and <em>Rediscovering Holiness</em>. He has preached and lectured widely in Great Britain and North America and served as general editor of the English Standard Version of the Bible published in 2001, and theological editor of the Study Bible version. In 2014, Packer was named Author of the Year by the Association of Logos Bookstores. He is a frequent contributor to and an executive editor of <em>Christianity Today</em> and has written numerous articles published in journals such as <em>Churchman, SouthWestern Journal, Reformation Revival Journal</em> and <em>Touchstone.</em> He received a BA, MA and PhD from Oxford University.Robertson Dean&#39;s masterful narration brings what could otherwise be a dry subject to life. With seamless narratives and attention to detail he delivers Sproul&#39;s lessons on how to read the Bible. Dean&#39;s perfect timing lays the practical groundwork for personal study of the scriptures and equips listeners to dig out underlying biblical meanings with discernment and common sense. With clarity Dean exposes two common myths noted by the author: The Bible is too difficult to understand without theological training and the Bible is boring, outdated, and irrelevant to our time. As the author discusses why the Bible should be studied and provides rules of interpretation for lay readers, Dean portrays the historical biblical narrative, as well as biblical culture, principles, and customs, with authenticity. Sproul&#39;s teaching is a valuable resource for church, Sunday school, or individual use.

The Colonel opened his long arms and scooped me in.</p><p>Miss Lana says hugging the Colonel&#x2019;s like hugging a turning plow, but I like the scrawny steel of his muscles and the jutting angles of his bones. &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d still be in bed, resting,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He tightened the belt of his green plaid robe I gave him for Christmas the year I turned six. &#x201c;Dale told me you had a stranger,&#x201d; he said, eyeing Starr.</p><p>I pointed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Joe Starr,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a lawman.&#x201d; Everyone in the caf� pivoted to squint at Starr, who stood stock-still, the way you do when a mad dog comes near. &#x201c;He looks like trouble,&#x201d; I continued, keeping my voice low, &#x201c;but he&#x2019;s nothing I can&#x2019;t handle.&#x201d; I smiled at Starr. &#x201c;No offense,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;None taken,&#x201d; Starr said easily.</p><p>&#x201c;Except for that, everything&#x2019;s going great.

Almost before the dust had settled, Mr. Jesse turned up dead and life in Tupelo Landing turned upside down.</p><p>As far as I know, nobody expected it.</p><p>As for me&#x2014;Miss Moses LoBeau, rising sixth grader&#x2014;trouble was the <i>last</i> thing on my mind as I crept across Dale&#x2019;s front porch at six o&#x2019;clock that morning. &#x201c;Hey Dale,&#x201d; I whispered, pressing my face against his sagging window screen. &#x201c;Wake up.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned over, tugging at his sheet. &#x201c;Go &#x2019;way,&#x201d; he mumbled. His mongrel dog, Queen Elizabeth II, stirred beneath a hydrangea at the porch&#x2019;s edge.</p><p>Dale sleeps with his window up in summer partly because he likes to hear the tree frogs and crickets, but mostly because his daddy&#x2019;s too sorry to bring home any air-conditioning. &#x201c;Dale!&#x201d; I bellowed. &#x201c;Wake up! It&#x2019;s Mo.&#x201d; Dale sat bolt upright, his blue eyes round and his blond hair spiking in all directions.</p><p>&#x201c;Demons!&#x201d; he gasped, pointing vaguely in my direction.</p><p>I sighed. Dale&#x2019;s family is Baptist. &#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t demons, it&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I stopped by to tell you: The Colonel&#x2019;s come home and he ain&#x2019;t up to cooking.&#x201d;</p><p>He blinked like a stunned owl. &#x201c;You woke me up for that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Dale, I got to open the caf� today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Dale said, his disappointment riding the word to the ground. &#x201c;But we been planning this fishing trip forever, Mo,&#x201d; he said, rubbing his eyes. &#x201c;How about Miss Lana? Can&#x2019;t she whip up some craps, or&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Crepes,&#x201d;</i> I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s French. And no, she can&#x2019;t. Miss Lana slammed out just after the Colonel slipped in. She&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p><p>He swore, his voice soft as a breeze through the reeds. Dale started swearing last year. I haven&#x2019;t started yet, but the way things are going, I could at any moment.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Dale. We&#x2019;ll have to go fishing another time. I can&#x2019;t let the Colonel and Miss Lana down.&#x201d;</p><p>The Colonel and Miss Lana are the closest thing to family I&#x2019;ve got. Without them, I wouldn&#x2019;t have a home. I probably wouldn&#x2019;t even have a name. I am bereft of kin by fate, as Miss Lana puts it, washed into my current, rather odd life by Forces Unknown.</p><p>Just then, Dale&#x2019;s bedroom door creaked open and his mama leaned into the room, her green eyes soft from sleep. &#x201c;Dale?&#x201d; she whispered, clutching a faded pink housecoat to her throat. &#x201c;You all right? You aren&#x2019;t having nightmares again, are you, baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worse than that, Mama,&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;Mo&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Rose used to be a real beauty, back before time and Dale&#x2019;s daddy got hold of her. That&#x2019;s what people say: coal-black hair, a tilt to her chin, and a sway that made men stand taller.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Miss Rose,&#x201d; I said, pressing my best smile against the window screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Lord have mercy,&#x201d; she said, staggering back. &#x201c;What time is it, Mo?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A whisker past six,&#x201d; I said, smiling. &#x201c;I sure hope you slept well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;for a shockingly brief period of time.&#x201d; Like Dale, Miss Rose doesn&#x2019;t necessarily wake up good. Her voice took on a silky, dangerous tone. &#x201c;And you are on my porch before the sun has wiped the sleep from its eyes because ... ?&#x201d;</p><p>I took a deep breath. &#x201c;Because the Colonel&#x2019;s back but Miss Lana&#x2019;s gone, so I got to open the caf�, which means Dale and me can&#x2019;t go fishing, and I feel like it would be rude not to let him know. I&#x2019;m just trying to do what&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I concluded.</p><p>A tiny frown creased her forehead.</p><p>Fortunately, Miss Rose is a person of manners and, as Miss Lana says, manners will tell. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she finally said, &#x201c;as long as we&#x2019;re all awake, won&#x2019;t you come in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Dale said, swinging his legs over the side of his bed. &#x201c;Me and Mo are opening the caf� today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mo and I,&#x201d; she murmured as he stood up fully dressed and stepped into a pair of sandals that looked way too big. She blinked. &#x201c;What happened to your pajamas? And why are you wearing your brother&#x2019;s old shoes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sleeping in my clothes saves time, and my feet are growing,&#x201d; he replied, shoving his black T-shirt into his shorts and running his fingers through his hair. The men in Dale&#x2019;s family are vain about their hair, and with good reason.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s growing feet first,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;The rest of him will catch up later.&#x201d; Dale is the second-smallest kid in our class. Only Sally Amanda Jones is smaller. Dale&#x2019;s sensitive. &#x201c;Gotta go!&#x201d; I shouted, and grabbed my bike and headed across the yard.</p><p>Dale caught up with me just outside town. We coasted past the mayor&#x2019;s new sign&#x2014;WELCOME TO TUPELO LANDING, NC, POPULATION: 148&#x2014;and skidded to a halt in the caf� parking lot, kicking up a rooster tail of oyster shells and sand. &#x201c;Holy moly,&#x201d; he said, dropping his bike. &#x201c;Looks like the Colonel&#x2019;s got a new car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A &#x2019;58 Underbird,&#x201d; I said modestly. &#x201c;Original paint.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a Thunderbird,&#x201d; he said, strolling around the car.</p><p>Dale&#x2019;s family knows cars. In fact, his big brother Lavender, who I will one day marry, races at Carolina Raceway. Dale kicked a tire and squinted at the silvery letters sprawling across the car&#x2019;s fender. &#x201c;Used to be a Thunderbird,&#x201d; he announced. &#x201c;Looks like the <i>T</i> and <i>H</i> fell off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s an Underbird now,&#x201d; I said, waving my key in front of the caf�&#x2019;s door.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why you do that,&#x201d; he said, watching me. &#x201c;Everybody in town knows that door won&#x2019;t lock.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t do this for everybody in town; I do it in case of strangers. You can&#x2019;t be too careful about strangers. That&#x2019;s what the Colonel says.&#x201d;</p><p>Dale grabbed my arm. &#x201c;Wait. Don&#x2019;t open up today, Mo. Please? Let&#x2019;s go fishing. I was going to surprise you, but ... I got us a boat.&#x201d;</p><p>I froze, the door half-open. &#x201c;A boat? Where&#x2019;d you get a boat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Jesse&#x2019;s,&#x201d; he said, rocking back on his heels.</p><p>I tried not to sound impressed. &#x201c;You stole Mr. Jesse&#x2019;s boat?&#x201d;</p><p>He studied his fingernails. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t say <i>stole,</i>&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I did borrow it pretty strong.&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t, Dale. Not today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tomorrow, then.&#x201d; He grinned, grabbing the CLOSED sign and flipping it to OPEN.</p><p>Dale&#x2019;s my best friend. By now, you can see why.</p><p>We barely had time to rev up the air conditioner and click on the ceiling fans before our first customer stumbled in. I won&#x2019;t say our patrons are an ugly lot, but at 6:30 a.m., they ain&#x2019;t pretty. I stepped up on the Pepsi crate behind the counter as Mr. Jesse came sauntering in, thin-shouldered and round-bellied, wearing a faded plaid shirt, khakis, and last night&#x2019;s whiskers. &#x201c;Morning, Mr. Jesse,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;ll it be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Mo,&#x201d; he said, grabbing a menu. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you be in school?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;School ended last week, Mr. Jesse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh? What grade will you ... ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sixth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sixth grade? Good gracious, girl,&#x201d; he said, looking at me for the first time. &#x201c;You <i>are</i> growing.&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m standing on a Pepsi crate, Mr. Jesse. I ain&#x2019;t grown that much since yesterday. You want to order? I got other customers to think about.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked around the deserted caf� as the 7UP clock ticked loud and lonely on the far wall. &#x201c;Other customers? Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On their way over here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Lessee then,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m in a mood for. Some jackass stole my boat last night, took my appetite with it.&#x201d; Dale dropped a glass. &#x201c;Big-footed buzzard, too, from his prints,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing he&#x2019;s at least six foot four and a good two hundred twenty pounds.&#x201d; Dale kicked his oversize sandals under the counter. Mr. Jesse licked his thin lips. &#x201c;Miss Lana take her biscuits out of the oven yet?&#x201d;</p><p>I made my voice gentle, the way Miss Lana does when I have a fever. &#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t having biscuits today, Mr. Jesse,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. Then: &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; He sniffed the air like a hound, and a frown flashed across his unshaven face. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t smell right in here,&#x201d; he announced. &#x201c;No coffee, no bacon, no biscuits ...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Lana&#x2019;s taking some time off,&#x201d; I said, keeping my voice low. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably for the best. Her biscuits are awfully fattening and you could stand to lose that belly, Mr. Jesse. You know you could.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes darted to the gray double doors leading to the kitchen. &#x201c;Is the Colonel back there?&#x201d; he demanded. I couldn&#x2019;t blame him for being nervous.</p><p>&#x201c;Want me to see if he&#x2019;s in?&#x201d; I offered, stepping off my Pepsi crate. I won&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m short, but without the crate, I&#x2019;m not tall.</p><p>&#x201c;Disturb the Colonel?&#x201d; he gasped. &#x201c;No! Heavens no. I just like to know when he&#x2019;s in town.&#x201d; He dropped the menu. &#x201c;What do you suggest this morning, Mo?&#x201d;</p><p>I stood up straight, the way Miss Lana taught me, and draped a paper napkin over my arm. &#x201c;This morning we&#x2019;re offering a full line of peanut butter entr�es,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We got peanut butter and jelly, peanut butter and raisins, and a delicate peanut butter/peanut butter combination. These come crunchy or smooth, on Wonder Bread, hand-squished flat on the plate or not, as you prefer. The special today is our famous peanut butter and banana sandwich. It comes on Wonder Bread, cut diagonal on the plate, with crust or without. What can I start you with?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The special,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;An excellent choice. Hand-squished or fluffy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fluffy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No crust. And ...&#x201d; He gazed at the coffeemaker, his pale eyes hopeful. &#x201c;Coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;Our drink du jour is Mountain Dew,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I got a two-liter breathing in back.&#x201d;</p><p>His shoulders slumped.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning!&#x201d; Mayor Little sang out, the door slapping shut behind him. He smoothed his ice-blue tie over his pudgy belly and flashed an unnaturally white smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Hush!&#x201d; Mr. Jesse barked. &#x201c;Miss Lana&#x2019;s gone and the Colonel could be in the kitchen!&#x201d;</p><p>Mayor Little tiptoed to the counter, his polished loafers <i>tick-tick-ticking</i> across the tile floor. &#x201c;Miss Lana gone? The Colonel back? An unfortunate turn of events, but put in an historical context, it&#x2019;s nothing the town can&#x2019;t handle,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;Morning, Mo. Give me a special and drink du jour. No ice. My gums are giving me fits.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coming up,&#x201d; I said, turning away.</p><p>We always choose a Little for mayor in case a television crew ever comes to town. Littles like to talk and they&#x2019;re naturally neat; even their babies dress good. As the mayor sipped his Mountain Dew, the breakfast crowd trickled in.</p><p>Grandmother Miss Lacy Thornton parked her Buick by the Underbird and strolled to a table by the window. Grandmother Miss Lacy Thornton always wears a navy-blue suit and shoes. Their color offsets her white-blue hair, which she sweeps up in a halo around her heart-shaped face. She stands just a little taller than me, but somehow looms above everyone in the room.</p><p>Tinks Williams darted in next to grab a sandwich, leaving his John Deere tractor idling in a patch of shade. Then came slow-talking Sam Quinerly, Lavender&#x2019;s racing partner and mechanic. He already had grease on his hands. Before Dale could make Sam&#x2019;s sandwich, in strolled Reverend Thompson and his boy, Thessalonians.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Thes,&#x201d; I said, sliding him a glass of water. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s summer school?&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned, his carrot-colored hair glistening. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t know. I ain&#x2019;t going.&#x201d;</p><p>Like me, Thes doesn&#x2019;t over-study. Unlike me, he&#x2019;s F-prone. I keep my borderline straight A&#x2019;s to myself, preferring to spring my brainpower on others when they least expect it. I take after Miss Lana that way. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you wiggle out of that?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Makeup tests, and prayer,&#x201d; Reverend Thompson muttered.</p><p>Thes beamed. &#x201c;Hey Mo, we got three potential hurricanes off Africa this morning. I figure we got a thirty percent chance one will make it all the way to us.&#x201d; Thes is a weather freak. He dreams of being a TV weatherman, and updates for practice. As far as I know, there&#x2019;s no way to stop him.</p><p>&#x201c;A couple of specials, please, Mo,&#x201d; Reverend Thompson said.</p><p>&#x201c;Coming up.&#x201d;</p><p>By 7:30 half the town had crowded into the caf� and rising seventh grader Skeeter McMillan&#x2014;tall, slender, freckles the color of fresh-sliced baloney&#x2014;had claimed the counter&#x2019;s last spot.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Mo,&#x201d; Skeeter said, propping her law book open. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have the alleged special, please.&#x201d; Skeeter, who hopes to one day be an attorney, loves to say &#x201c;alleged&#x201d; and &#x201c;perp.&#x201d; Rumor has it she&#x2019;s already written to Matchbook University for a paralegal course under an assumed name. She won&#x2019;t say if that&#x2019;s true or false, only that unsubstantiated rumor won&#x2019;t hold up in court.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey Skeeter, the Colonel&#x2019;s back,&#x201d; Dale told her, speeding by.</p><p>She swept her law book into her bag. &#x201c;Make mine to go,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The Colonel hates lawyers. We allow Skeeter to come in, since she&#x2019;s only in training, but she keeps a low profile out of pride.</p><p>By 8:30, Dale and I were tearing around like our shirttails were on fire. I am permitted to serve meals since the caf� is a family business, but not to use the stove, which the Colonel says could be dangerous for someone of my height and temperament. The pre-lunch lull found me opening jars of Miss Lana&#x2019;s Practically Organic Garden Soup&#x2014;which, fortunately, serves up good cold in the bowl. &#x201c;Miss Lana better come home soon,&#x201d; I said, twisting the ring off a quart jar. &#x201c;This is the last of her soup, and I ain&#x2019;t no gardener.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can say that again,&#x201d; Dale muttered.</p><p>Dale gets his green thumb from Miss Rose. I, personally, am practically herbicidal. I&#x2019;ve killed every plant I ever met, starting with my lima bean sprout in kindergarten.</p><p>As the lunch crowd drifted in, I plugged in the jukebox.

God's Book, the Bible, promises that Jesus will return to take His faithful followers to live with Him in His glorious presence forever (John 14:3). Everyone else will be <em>left behind</em> to face the most difficult times mankind has known.</p><p> </p><p>When will that happen? The Bible made clear predictions about the times leading up to Christ's coming for his own. It says that in those days people will be lovers of pleasure instead of God, truce breakers, blasphemers, unthankful. heartless, without self-control (2 Timothy 3:1-5).</p><p> </p><p>Clearly the evidence of those predictions being fulfilled is all around us. The news is filled with reports of greed, murders, robberies, immorality as well as a worldwide convulsion of violence and terrorism. All the signs seem to indicate that something will happen <em>soon</em>.</p><p> </p><p>After Jesus comes for his own "there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations" (Luke 21:25-26). Everything will be in upheaval, and there will be earthquakes, wars, violence, and people betraying one another. It all leads up to the ultimate rebellion against God--Armageddon.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Some things that won't change</strong></p><p>Despite the coming chaos on earth, some things will remain the same. What are they?</p><p> </p><p><strong>The nature of God never changes.</strong> He is unchanging in His holiness and His righteousness. God said, "I am the Lord [God], I change not" (Malachi 3:6). Don't let the nightly news frighten you. God knows what's going on down here and he will step in when the limit has been reached. Only he knows what that limit is.</p><p> </p><p><strong>God's judgment is coming</strong>; <em>that</em> hasn't changed. The Bible says that the Lord will one day judge all the nations of the world. But also<strong> God is unchanging in His love</strong>. He loves you and he has a plan for your life. Jesus said, "I have come that they [who believe in me] might have life and they might have it abundantly" (John 10:10).</p><p> </p><p>Something else that hasn't changed is the <strong>Word of God, the Bible</strong>. "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the Word of our God shall stand forever" (Isaiah 40:8). What God says is unchanging.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Human nature doesn't change</strong>. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked" (Jeremiah 17:9). We're all sinners--sinners by birth and by practice. We cannot be reconciled to God and go to heaven unless our sins are forgiven <em>by God</em>. That's why Christ came to earth the first time 2000 years ago to die on a cross.</p><p> </p><p>And the <strong>promise of His return to earth to rule the nations hasn't changed</strong>. Christ said before He left, "When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory" (Matthew 25:31-32).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Something that <em>will</em> change</strong></p><p>Since Jesus made that promise long ago, people have always asked, "Where is the promise of His coming?" (2 Peter 3:4). Has something gone wrong? No, everything is going according to God's timetable. God will come to bring peace and justice to earth, but until then he is giving people <em>time</em> to change their minds about who he is and what he has done for them. "The Lord...is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance" (2 Peter 3:9).</p><p> </p><p>Do <em>you</em> doubt that Jesus will ever return to earth to set things right? Are you living like you'll never face God as your judge? <em>Then you're in danger of being left behind!</em></p><p> </p><p>The Bible says there's only one way <em>not</em> to be left behind...</p><p>- Admit that you're a sinner in need of God's forgiveness. We "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).</p><p>- Believe that Jesus Christ died for you on the cross, came back to life from the grave, and is your only way to heaven. "God [shows] his love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).</p><p>- Turn from trusting in anything or anyone else for eternal life and trust <em>only</em> in Christ. "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).</p><p>- Accept Jesus' offer to forgive your sins and become your Savior. In Christ we have "the forgiveness of sins" (Colossians 1:14).</p><p> </p><p>If that's your heart's true desire, you can tell Jesus in words like these: </p><p>Dear Jesus, I agree with you that I'm a sinner in need of your salvation. I also believe that you died in my place, taking the punishment I deserved for my sins. I accept your offer of forgiveness and eternal life. I now receive you as my Savior. Help me to live from now on to please you. I look forward to meeting you in person!</p><p> </p><p>If Jesus were to come today to take those who believe in him to heaven, would you be included? I hope you'll accept God's offer of salvation and make your future secure. <em>Don't be left behind!</em></p></p><p></p><h2>The 16% Solution: How to Get High Interest Rates in a Low-Interest World with Tax Lien Certificates, Revised Edition</h2><p><b>IN <i>RICH DAD POOR DAD</i></b> <b>YOU FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THIS BOOK.&nbsp; <i>NOW READ THE BOOK AND START COLLECTING HIGH INTEREST PAYMENTS!</i></b><b><i>.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b>Like millions of others, you are probably wondering where to put your money in these low interest times.&nbsp; Money market funds, banks, and savings and loans are paying less than 5% interest.&nbsp; After taxes and inflation, a 5% return leaves you nothing at all.</b><b>.</b><b>Eager for higher yields, you may be considering joining millions of others who are rushing into an already overpriced stock market.&nbsp; Or you may be considering buying bonds, options, or more exotic instruments that may one day cost you some or most of your principal.</b><b>.</b><b>There is an alternative.&nbsp; An investment that will allow you to reap ultra-high yields.&nbsp; An investment that will allow you to sleep at night.&nbsp; An investment you can get into with very little money.&nbsp; An investment that is fun.&nbsp; I wrote this book to introduce you to that investment, known as tax lien certificates.</b><b>.</b><b>Tax lien certificates are not some new invention of a brokerage.&nbsp; They are issued by over 1,000 local governments in a majority of states.&nbsp; Banks, savings and loans, and many knowledgeable investors hold them.&nbsp; Now it's your turn to find out about them, and your turn to profit from them.</b><b>.</b><b>Frankly, I'm excited for you.&nbsp; You are in for a wonderful, profitable discovery and I am delighted to be your guide and companion.</b><b>.</b><b>Joel Moskowitz</b><b><i>Joel S.

In other words, she has the &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; life. But everything changes the night her husband James comes home and confesses an indiscretion. Suddenly, her neat, ordered world is turned upside down. Did she ever really know the man she married?<br> <br> James&#x2019;s revelation, as it turns out, is just the tip of the iceberg: a larger scandal is about to explode. James stands accused of a terrible crime, and their family is shoved into the spotlight as his trial begins. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, another woman is working to destroy Sophie&#x2019;s husband. Sophie remains convinced of James&#x2019;s innocence and is desperate to protect her precious family from the rumors that threaten to rip them apart. She&#x2019;s kept his darkest secret ever since their university days. And if she stood by him then, she can do it now. But, the truth is even more shocking than anyone ever could have thought. Is James the guilty perpetrator or an innocent victim of a toxic agenda?<br> <br> In this riveting story of power, revenge, and deception, no one&#x2019;s motives are pure, but some people&#x2019;s secrets are much darker than others.</p><p>Sarah Vaughan studied English at Oxford and went on to become a journalist. She spent eleven years at <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i> as a news reporter, health correspondent, and political correspondent. Sarah lives in Cambridge with her husband and two children.Sophie has never thought of her husband as a liar.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knows he dissembles, yes. That&#x2019;s part of his job&#x2014;a will�ingness to be economical with the truth. A prerequisite, even for a government minister.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she has never imagined he would lie to her. Or rather, that he might have a life she knows nothing about: a secret that could detonate beneath her lovingly maintained world and blow it apart forever.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watching him that Friday, as he leaves to take the children to school, she feels a stab of love so fierce she pauses on the stairs just to drink in the tableau of the three of them together. They are framed in the doorway, James turning to call good�bye, left arm raised in that politician&#x2019;s wave she used to mock but which now seems second nature, right hand cradling Finn&#x2019;s head. Their son&#x2014;fringe falling in his eyes, socks bagging round his ankles&#x2014;scuffs at the tiles, reluctant, as ever, to go. His elder sister, Emily, ducks through the doorway: age nine, determined not to be late.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, bye, then,&#x201d; her husband calls, and the autumn sun catches the top of his still-boyish crop, illuminating him with a halo, highlighting his six-foot-three frame.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Bye, Mum,&#x201d; her daughter shouts, as she runs down the steps.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Bye, Mummy.&#x201d; Finn, thrown by the change to his routine&#x2014; his father taking them to school for once&#x2014;juts out his bottom lip and flushes red.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Come on, little man.&#x201d; James steers him through the door: competent, authoritative even, and she almost resents the fact that she still finds this attractive, commanding. Then he smiles down at his boy and his entire face softens. Finn is his weak spot. &#x201c;You know you&#x2019;ll enjoy it when you get there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slips his arm over his son&#x2019;s shoulders and guides him down their neat, West London garden, with its sculpted bay trees standing like sentinels and its path fringed with lavender, away from her and out down the street.<br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My family</i>, she thinks, watching the perfect-looking trio go&#x2014;her girl racing ahead to embrace the day, all skinny legs and swishing ponytail, her boy slipping his hand into his father&#x2019;s and looking up at him with that unashamed adoration that comes with being six. The similarity between man and boy&#x2014;for Finn is a miniaturized version of his father&#x2014;only magnifies her love. <i>I have a beautiful boy and a beautiful man</i>, she thinks, as she watches James&#x2019;s broad shoulders&#x2014;a one-time rower&#x2019;s shoulders&#x2014;and waits, more in hope than expectation, for him to look back and smile at her, for she has never managed to grow immune to his charisma.<br><br> Of course he doesn&#x2019;t and she watches as they slip out of sight. The most precious people in her world.<br><br> That world crumbles at 8:43 p.m. James is late. She should have known he would be. It is an alternate Friday: one in which he is holding a constituency meeting, deep in the Surrey countryside, in a brightly lit village hall.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he had first been elected, they had stayed there every weekend: decamping to a cold, damp cottage that had never quite felt like home, despite their extensive renovations. One election on, and it was a relief to give up the pretense that Thurlsdon was where they wanted to spend half their week. Lovely in the sum�mer months, yes, but bleak in winter, when she would stare out at the bare trees fringing their hamlet garden and try to placate their urban children, who wanted the bustle and distraction of their real, North Kensington home.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They venture there once a month now, and James schleps down for a meeting in the intervening fortnight. Two hours on a Friday afternoon; he promised to leave by six.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has a driver now that he is junior minister and should have been back by seven thirty&#x2014;traffic permitting. They are sup�posed to be going to friends&#x2019; for a kitchen supper. Well, she says <i>friends</i>. Matt Frisk is another junior minister&#x2014;aggressively ambitious in a way that doesn&#x2019;t sit well with their set, where success is understood as inevitable but naked ambition considered vulgar.<br><br> But he and Ellie are near neighbors and she couldn&#x2019;t easily put them off again.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sophie had said they would be there by eight fifteen. It was ten past now, so where was he? The October evening crept against the sash windows: black softened by the glow of the street lamps, autumn stealing in. She loves this time of year. It reminds her of fresh starts, running through the leaves in Christ Church Meadows as a fresher, giddy at the thought of new worlds opening up to her. Since having children, it has been a time to nest; to cosset with log fires, roast chestnuts, take brisk, crisp walks, and make game casseroles. But now, the autumn night was taut with apprehension. Footsteps tottered down the pavement and a woman&#x2019;s laugh rang out, flirtatious. A deeper voice murmured. Not James&#x2019;s. The footsteps rose and fell, died away.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pressed redial. His mobile rang then clicked to voicemail. She jabbed the sleek face of her phone&#x2014;rattled at her loss of cus�tomary self-control. Dread tightened her stomach and for a mo�ment she was back in the chill lodge of her Oxford college, the wind whistling through the quad, as she waited for the pay phone to ring. The look of sympathy from a college porter. The chill fear&#x2014;so intense in that last week of her first summer term&#x2014;that something still more terrible was about to happen. Age nineteen and willing him to call, even then.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eight fourteen. She tried again, hating herself for doing it. His phone clicked straight through to voicemail. She plucked at a piece of imaginary lint, rearranged her friendship bracelets, and glanced critically at her nails&#x2014;neatly filed, unvarnished, unlike Ellie&#x2019;s gleaming gelled slicks.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Footsteps on the stairs. A child&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Is Daddy back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, go back to bed.&#x201d; Her tone came out harsher than she intended.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Emily stared, one eyebrow raised.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Just climb back into bed, sweetheart,&#x201d; she added, her voice softening as she chased her daughter up the stairs, heart quicken�ing as she turned the corner and bundled her under the covers. &#x201c;You should be settling down, now. He won&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can he come and say goodnight when he gets in?&#x201d; Emily pouted, impossibly pretty.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re going out, but if you&#x2019;re still awake . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I will be.&#x201d; Her daughter&#x2019;s determination&#x2014;the set of her jaw, the implacable self-belief&#x2014;marked her out as her father&#x2019;s daugh�ter.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll come up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sophie gave her a quick peck on the forehead, to curb further arguments, and tucked the duvet around her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you out of bed again, though. Understand? Cristina&#x2019;s babysitting just like normal. I&#x2019;ll send Daddy up when he gets back.&#x201d;<br><br> Eight seventeen. She forced herself not to ring his number. She has never been the sort of wife who behaves like a stalker, but there was something about this complete silence that chilled her. It just wasn&#x2019;t like him. She imagined him stuck on the M25, working his way through his papers in the back of his car. He would call, text, send an email, not leave her waiting&#x2014;the au pair hanging around the kitchen, keen for them to disap�pear so that she can curl up on the sofa and have the house to herself; Sophie&#x2019;s carefully touched-up face becoming a little less perfect; the flowers bought for the Frisks wilting in their wrap�ping on the table in the hall.<br><br> Eight twenty-one. She would call the Frisks at half past. But that deadline came and still she didn&#x2019;t ring. Eight thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven. Aware that it was bad form to do so, at eight forty she sent Ellie Frisk a brief, apologetic text explain�ing that something had cropped up in the constituency and they were terribly sorry but they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to make it, after all.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <i>Times</i> had a piece on the Islamic State by Will Stanhope but the words of her old college contemporary washed over her. It might as well be a story about dinosaur astronauts, read to Finn, to the extent to which it engaged her. Every part of her was attuned to one thing.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there it is. The sound of his key in the door. A scrape and then a hiss as the heavy oak eases open. The sound of his footsteps: slower than normal, not his usual brisk, assertive tread. Then the thud of his red box being put down, the weight of responsibility abandoned for a while&#x2014;as glorious a sound, on a Friday night, as the slosh of dry white wine being poured from a bottle. The jangle of keys on the hall table. And then silence again.<br><br> &#x201c;James?&#x201d; She comes into the hall.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beautiful face is grey, his smile taut and not reaching his eyes, where his light crow&#x2019;s feet seemed deeper than usual.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better cancel the Frisks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I have done.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shrugs off his coat and hangs it up carefully, averting his face.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pauses then slips her arms around his waist&#x2014;his honed waist that deepens to form a V, like the trunk of a sapling that burgeons outwards&#x2014;but he reaches back and gently eases them away.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;James?&#x201d; The cold in the pit of her stomach flares.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is Cristina here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, send her to her room, will you? We need to talk in private.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Her heart flutters as she hears her voice come out clipped.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gives her another tight smile, and a note of impatience creeps into his voice, as if she is a disobliging child, or perhaps, a tardy civil servant. &#x201c;Can you do it now, please, Sophie?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stares back at him, not recognizing his mood&#x2014;so differ�ent to what she had expected.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He massages his forehead with firm, long fingers, and his green eyes close briefly, the lashes&#x2014;disarmingly long&#x2014;kissing his cheeks. Then, his eyes flash open, and the look he gives her is the one Finn gives when he is trying to preempt a telling off and plead forgiveness. It&#x2019;s the look James gave her twenty-three years ago be�fore confessing to the crisis that had threatened to overwhelm him, that had caused them to split up, that still sometimes causes her to shiver, and that she fears is about to rear its head again.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Soph. So sorry.&#x201d; And it is as if he is carrying not just the weight of his job&#x2014;undersecretary of state for countering extremism&#x2014;but responsibility for the entire government.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve fucked up big time.&#x201d;<br><br> Her name was Olivia Lytton&#x2014;though Sophie had always just thought of her as James&#x2019;s parliamentary researcher&#x2014;five foot ten, twenty-eight, blonde, well connected, confident, ambitious.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I expect she&#x2019;ll be dubbed the blonde bombshell.&#x201d; She tries for acerbic, but her voice just comes out as shrill.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The affair had been going on for five months, and he had broken it off a week ago, just after the party conference.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It meant nothing,&#x201d; James says, head in hands, no pretense that he is anything other than penitent. He leans back, wrinkling his nose as he trots out another clich�. &#x201c;It was just sex, and I was flattered.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She swallows, rage pushing against her chest, barely contain-able. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s OK then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes darken as he takes in her pain.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There was nothing wrong with that part of us. You know that.&#x201d; He can usually read her so clearly: a skill honed over two decades, one of the things that binds them so closely. &#x201c;I just made a foolish mistake.&#x201d;<br><br> She waits, poised on the sofa opposite, for her anger to subside sufficiently for her to speak civilly, or for him to bridge the distance between them. To reach out a tentative hand, or at least offer a smile.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he is rooted there: head bowed, elbows on knees, fin�gers touching as if in prayer. At first, she despises this show of sanctimony&#x2014;a Blairite trope, the penitent politician&#x2014;and then she softens as his shoulders shake, just the once, not with a sob but with a sigh. For a moment, she sees her mother as her charm�ing, rakish father confessed to yet another &#x201c;indiscretion.&#x201d; Ginny&#x2019;s dry resignation, and then the quickly suppressed flash of pain in her marine-blue eyes.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps this is what all husbands do? Sorrow surges, then anger. It shouldn&#x2019;t be like this. Their marriage is different. Founded on love and trust and a sex life that she does her very best to maintain.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has made compromises in her life, and God knows, she took a huge leap of faith when they got back together. But the one certainty was that their relationship is solid. Her vision be�gins to blur, her gaze filming with tears. He looks up and catches her eye&#x2014;and she wishes he hadn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else,&#x201d; he says.<br><br> Of <i>course </i>he wouldn&#x2019;t confess to an affair without a reason.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is she pregnant?&#x201d; The words&#x2014;ugly but necessary&#x2014;discolor the space between them.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, of course not.&#x201d;<br><br> She feels herself relax a little. No half-sibling for Emily and Finn. No proof of a liaison. No need to share him in any other way.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then he looks up with a grimace. Her nails bite into her palm in sharp crescents, and she sees that her knuckles are ivory pearls thrusting through the red of her skin.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What could be worse than some other woman having his child, or perhaps choosing to abort his child? Other people knowing. The affair, a particularly juicy piece of gossip, dropped into the ear of a favored few in the Commons tea rooms until it becomes general knowledge. Who knows? His colleagues? The PM? Other MPs&#x2019; wives? What about Ellie? She imagines Ellie&#x2019;s silly, plump face alight with barely suppressed pity. Perhaps she already knows and recognized her lie of a text.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sophie forces herself to breathe deeply. They can deal with this; move beyond it. They have experienced far worse, haven&#x2019;t they? There is no crime in having a quick fling. It can be brushed over, quickly forgotten, absorbed. And then James says something that takes this to a more damaging, corrosive level that strikes her in the solar plexus hard as she contemplates a scenario so terrible that, fool that she is, she hadn&#x2019;t quite seen coming.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The story&#x2019;s about to break.&#x201d;</p><h2>Go, Go, Go!

The bathtub had bubble jets. There was an endless supply of fat towels and liquid gardenia soap. In the lobby, an elderly gentleman played Gershwin on a grand piano at four each afternoon. You could get hot clay skin treatments, if you didn&#x2019;t mind strangers touching you. Jule&#x2019;s skin smelled like chlorine all day.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Playa Grande Resort in Baja had white curtains, white tile, white carpets, and explosions of lush white flowers. The staff members were nurselike in their white cotton garments. Jule had been alone at the hotel for nearly four weeks now. She was eighteen years old.<br> &nbsp;<br> This morning, she was running in the Playa Grande gym. She wore custom sea-green shoes with navy laces. She ran without music. She had been doing intervals for nearly an hour when a woman stepped onto the treadmill next to her.<br> &nbsp;<br> This woman was younger than thirty. Her black hair was in a tight ponytail, slicked with hair spray. She had big arms and a solid torso, light brown skin, and a dusting of powdery blush on her cheeks. Her shoes were down at the heels and spattered with old mud.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one else was in the gym.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jule slowed to a walk, figuring to leave in a minute. She liked privacy, and she was pretty much done, anyway.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You training?&#x201d; the woman asked. She gestured at Jule&#x2019;s digital readout. &#x201c;Like, for a marathon or something?&#x201d; The accent was Mexican American. She was probably a New Yorker raised in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I ran track in secondary school. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; Jule&#x2019;s own speech was clipped, what the British call BBC English.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman gave her a penetrating look. &#x201c;I like your accent,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Where you from?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;London. St. John&#x2019;s Wood.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;New York.&#x201d; The woman pointed to herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jule stepped off the treadmill to stretch her quads.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here alone,&#x201d; the woman confided after a moment. &#x201c;Got in last night. I booked this hotel at the last minute. You been here long?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s never long enough,&#x201d; said Jule, &#x201c;at a place like this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So what do you recommend? At the Playa Grande?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jule didn&#x2019;t often talk to other hotel guests, but she saw no harm in answering. &#x201c;Go on the snorkel tour,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I saw a bloody huge moray eel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No kidding. An eel?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The guide tempted it with fish guts he had in a plastic milk jug. The eel swam out from the rocks. It must have been eight feet long. Bright green.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman shivered. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like eels.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You could skip it. If you scare easy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman laughed. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the food? I didn&#x2019;t eat yet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get the chocolate cake.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For breakfast?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, yeah. They&#x2019;ll bring it to you special, if you ask.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good to know. You traveling alone?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen, I&#x2019;m gonna jet,&#x201d; said Jule, feeling the conversation had turned personal. &#x201c;Cheerio.&#x201d; She headed for the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My dad&#x2019;s crazy sick,&#x201d; the woman said, talking to Jule&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking after him for a long time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A stab of sympathy. Jule stopped and turned.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Every morning and every night after work, I&#x2019;m with him,&#x201d; the woman went on. &#x201c;Now he&#x2019;s finally stable, and I wanted to get away so badly I didn&#x2019;t think about the price tag.

And dementia. He used to be the head of our family. Very macho. Strong in all his opinions. Now he&#x2019;s a twisted body in a bed. He doesn&#x2019;t even know where he is half the time.

A scar wound down her right forearm, jagged, like from a knife, not clean like from an operation. There was a story there.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen, do you like to play trivia?&#x201d; Jule asked, against her better judgment.<br> &nbsp;<br> A smile.

Yeah, all right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Jule. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll kill it. You&#x2019;ll be glad you took a vacation. I&#x2019;m strong on superheroes, spy movies, YouTubers, fitness, money, makeup, and Victorian writers. What about you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Victorian writers? Like Dickens?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, whatever.&#x201d; Jule felt her face flush. It suddenly seemed an odd set of things to be interested in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I love Dickens.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do.&#x201d; The woman smiled again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good on Dickens, cooking, current events, politics . . . let&#x2019;s see, oh, and cats.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right, then,&#x201d; said Jule. &#x201c;It starts at eight o&#x2019;clock in that lounge off the main lobby. The bar with sofas.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Eight o&#x2019;clock. You&#x2019;re on.&#x201d; The woman walked over and extended her hand. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name again?

However, the lessons are more suitable for high school students. The authors tell readers to minimize their liabilities such as credit-card debt while building assets, such as starting their own businesses. Examples of the latter include charging classmates to read their comic books or for borrowing their bicycles. The lessons encourage "financial intelligence," but seem to discourage readers from getting a traditional job and fail to mention the hard work and long hours involved in running one's own business. Keltie Thomas's <i>The Kids Guide to Money Cent$</i> (Kids Can, 2004) and Jamie Kyle McGillian's <i>The Kids' Money Book</i> (Sterling, 2003) offer far better advice.<i>&#x2013;Karen T.

This landmark work continues to be one of the most well-known and influential explorations of moral and ethical philosophy ever conceived. Expanding on the concepts from his previous work <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra, </i>Nietzsche adopts a polemic approach to past philosophers who, in his view, lacked critical sense in accepting flawed premises in their consideration of morality. The metaphysics of morality, Nietzsche argues, should not assume that a good man is simply the opposite of an evil man, rather merely different expression of humanity&#x2019;s common basic impulses.</p> <p>Controversial in its time, as well as hotly debated in the present, Nietzsche&#x2019;s work moves beyond conventional ethics to suggest that a universal morality for all human beings in non-existent &#x2013; perception, reason and experience are not static, but change according to an individual&#x2019;s perspective and interpretation. The work further argues that philosophic traditions such as &#x201c;truth,&#x201d; &#x201c;self-consciousness&#x201d; and &#x201c;free will&#x201d; are merely inventions of Western morality and that the &#x201c;will to power&#x201d; is the real driving force of all human behaviour. This volume:</p> <ul> <li>Critiques the belief that actions, including domination or injury to the weak, can be universally objectionable</li> <li>Explores themes of religion and &#x201c;master and slave&#x201d; morality</li> <li>Includes a collection of stunning aphorisms and observations of the human condition</li> </ul> <p>Part of the bestselling <i>Capstone Classics Series</i> edited by Tom Butler-Bowdon,this collectible, hard-back edition of <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> provides an accessible and insightful Introduction by leading Nietzsche authority Dr Christopher Janaway.</p> <p>This deluxe volume is perfect for anyone with interest in philosophy, psychology, science, history and literature.&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Spectrum Math Word Problems Grade 3 Workbook, Ages 8 to 9, 3rd Grade Math Word Problems, Fractions, Algebra Prep, Geometry, Multi-Step Word Problems, Money, and Time - 128 Pages</h2><p>The Spectrum� Word Problems Workbook for fourth grade features 128 pages of focused practice for essential math skills. <p></p><p>This standards-based workbook uses real-world applications to cover concepts like multi-step word problems, fractions, decimals and money, metric and customary measurement, graphs and probability, geometry, and basic algebra.

Throughout is a philosophical calmness, a sense of the intellectual mingling with the spirit of things. Most importantly, Huang makes this a useful I Ching, more useful for the current temperament than older, more self-conscious translations.&#x201d; <br>--<em>The Book Reader</em> <br> <br>Translated by the eminent Taoist Master Alfred Huang, <em>The Complete I Ching</em> has been praised by scholars and new students of the I Ching since its first edition.

Not that having a third girl is a bad thing; they just wanted something different. But I had my own set of plans, and when I was born on July 2, 1989, there I was: a little baby girl.<br> <br>With each child my parents had had an agreement. If they had a boy, my dad would choose the name, and if they had a girl, my mom would have the honor. My mom settled on the name Alexandra for me. I can only guess that&#x2019;s because my dad had chosen the &#x201c;boy name&#x201d; Alexander, and my mom decided to allow him just the smallest bit of influence.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s so funny is that even though my dad doted on his girls, he had a real vision of how he would have raised his son, if he&#x2019;d had one. He once said that since I was the third girl, &#x201c;he was going to make a boy out of me somehow.&#x201d; He was joking, of course&#x2014;he loves having three girls and wouldn&#x2019;t trade us for anything&#x2014;but I think he had certain hopes as a father. My dad grew up playing baseball, and he dreamed of a son playing it, living out what he&#x2019;d loved most as a little boy.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself, though. Way before my dad helped introduce me to athletics, I was just a little kid growing up in Diamond Bar, California, about twenty-five miles east of Los Angeles. Diamond Bar is a nice suburban community&#x2014;quiet, sunny, and generally happy. I liked it there. Mostly everyone knew one another, and I was able to walk to elementary and middle school.<br> <br>But there wasn&#x2019;t very much going on in Diamond Bar. It was a huge deal when we got a Target, and we didn&#x2019;t even have a chain restaurant until I was fifteen or so. It&#x2019;s the kind of place that you&#x2019;re happy to grow up in but also happy to get out of once you come of age. I think so much of my youth revolved around sports precisely because not much else happened around me.<br> <br>My parents basically grew up together. My dad was best friends with my mom&#x2019;s older brother, and he&#x2019;s as close with my mom&#x2019;s siblings as she is. In fact, he probably sees them even more than she does! My parents starting dating on and off when my mom was eighteen or so, and they got married and had my eldest sister when she was twenty-three and he was thirty-four.<br> <br>My dad owned and ran a small construction company, and my mom worked with him until she decided to get her master&#x2019;s degree when I was about six. My two older sisters, Jenny and Jeri, were my best friends. Jenny is six years older than me, and Jeri is four years older. I was very close to Jeri, experiencing intense ups and downs like you do with your friends, and Jenny was a little more of a mother figure to me, especially when my mom went back to school at night. She happily dove into a caretaking role and began cooking for the family and organizing things for us while our mom was at class.<br> <br>I was always in their shadow. When you&#x2019;re the third kid, it&#x2019;s just like that. You&#x2019;re considered &#x201c;the baby.&#x201d; And my mom always got us confused! When she&#x2019;d call me for something, she&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Jenny! Jeri! I mean Alex!&#x201d; She definitely valued us as individuals, but three girls can be a whirlwind!<br> <br>My parents were stricter with me than they were with my sisters. Even though I was kind of sweet and shy and not at all a troublemaker, they held me to a higher standard. Maybe they knew my potential, or maybe they wanted to do everything right for their last child.<br> <br>I remember we used to play so many games. Family games on Wednesday nights were always a big deal, especially with my dad. We&#x2019;d play gin rummy or Monopoly or other board games, and they were really competitive. That&#x2019;s where I got my fighting spirit; competition was a positive thing in our house, not a negative one. There were always winners and losers, though&#x2014;nobody would be handed a win out of pity. My mom was actually the only one who wouldn&#x2019;t laugh in your face when she won. If it was just me and her, the outcome of the game really didn&#x2019;t matter. But not my dad! He would literally do a dance around the house after he won. It was extremely annoying.<br> <br>Like I said, competition was all in good fun, but I&#x2019;m not sure how fun Jeri thought it was when I first beat her in a footrace. I&#x2019;d always been one step behind her in everything, but when I was nine I realized I was pretty fast and I might have a chance at doing something better than her. I&#x2019;d stopped thinking my name was &#x201c;Jeri&#x2019;s little sister&#x201d; instead of Alex, and I was going to assert myself!<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to beat you! You&#x2019;ve got no chance. I&#x2019;m going to win,&#x201d; Jeri yelled at me as we were about to race against each other at the school across from our house.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just you watch me,&#x201d; I said as I took off running.<br> <br>Jeri couldn&#x2019;t even keep up&#x2014;I crossed the finish line way before her. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;d deny it to this day, but I remember it clearly. I totally killed her.<br> <br>My dad really wanted us to be athletic, and we all played different sports when we were little. I played soccer, softball, basketball, volleyball, and even participated in local track meets, which I loved.<br> <br>I was probably three when I really learned how to catch a ball, and that was when Dad decided I was destined for softball. My sisters had been playing in a softball league for years, so I&#x2019;d seen lots of their games. I remember holding on to the fence outside one of their games, poking my nose through as I cheered them on. Dad signed me up for a team as soon as I was old enough, and from then on I played softball more often and more intensely than any other sport. The first team I played on was a T-ball team called the A&#x2019;s, and it was, of course, coached by my dad.<br> <br>Jenny and Jeri were really good at school, but I took to athletics a little more than them, so I think that&#x2019;s when my dad started pushing me harder than them. It wasn&#x2019;t in a bad way&#x2014;he just nudged me to do something I seemed naturally inclined toward and that I liked.<br> <br>We would go to Anaheim Angels baseball games all the time. My dad had season tickets for a few years, and every time we went, he made sure that I brought my glove just in case I caught a foul ball. It was always so fun going to games, but now that I&#x2019;m so into soccer, I look back and think, Wow, baseball is boring. Why did I enjoy it so much? Maybe it was just because I liked making my dad proud.<br> <br>One day when I was about nine, though, I decided I&#x2019;d had enough. I&#x2019;d been playing soccer since I was five, and I&#x2019;d realized that it was the sport for me.<br> <br>I turned to my dad and said, &#x201c;You know what? I don&#x2019;t like softball.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I could see the shocked look on my dad&#x2019;s face. I was so good! How was it possible that I didn&#x2019;t like it?<br> <br>&#x201c;I like soccer. I like to run.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad&#x2019;s face visibly softened. You see, he just wanted me to be happy and to chase my dreams. His goal&#x2014;for me to love softball as much as he loved baseball&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t the most important thing. He just wanted me to follow my passion, whatever it was. And it was clear that my passion was soccer.<br> <br>Pushing Moves You Forward<br> <br>There&#x2019;s probably someone really important in your life who pushes you toward a goal&#x2014;it could be your teacher, your mom, your grandfather, or someone else entirely&#x2014;and you might disagree with them sometimes. I disagreed with my dad all the time! But I think you still need to value their place in your life. If you listen to them and let them in, they will probably nudge you just a little harder to find your passion. I&#x2019;ll always thank my dad for doing that for me.</p><h2>199 Promises of God (Value Books)</h2><p><b>Take These Promises to the Bank!</b><br><br><i>What is it that keeps God's children hopeful in a hopeless world?

Kacey Dawson has always lived life on the edge--impulsively, sometimes recklessly. And now, as lead guitarist for a hot up-and-coming band, she is poised at the brink of fame and fortune. But she is torn between wanting to be a serious musician, and the demons that lure her down the glittering, but alcohol-soaked path of rock stardom. A wrecked concert in Las Vegas threatens to ruin her career entirely. She wakes up with the hangover from hell and no memory of the night before, or how she ended up on her limo driver&#x2019;s couch... Jonah Fletcher is running out of time. He knows his situation is hopeless, and he's vowed to make the most of the handful of months he has left to him. His plans include seeing the opening of his glass installation at a prestigious art gallery...they do not include falling in love with a wild, tempestuous rock musician who wound up passed out on his couch. Jonah sees that Kacey is on a path to self-destruction. He lets her crash with him for a few days to dry out and get her head on straight. But neither of them expected the deep connection they felt, or how that connection could grow so fast from friendship into something more. Something deep and pure and life-changing...something as fragile as glass, that they both know will shatter in the end no matter how hard they try to hold on to it. Full Tilt is a story about what it means to love with your whole heart, to sacrifice, to experience terrible grief and soaring joy. To live life with all its beauty, and all its pain, and in the end to be able to smile through tears and know you wouldn&#x2019;t have changed a thing. ***FIRST BOOK IN A TWO PART DUET*** All In (Full Tilt #2) forthcoming...</p><p></p><h2>The Tenth Good Thing About Barney</h2><p><i>My cat Barney died this Friday.

The world according to her is black and white; anything in between is confusing. Before, when things got confusing, Caitlin went to her older brother, Devon, for help. But Devon was killed in a school shooting, and Caitlin's dad is so distraught that he is just not helpful. Caitlin wants everything to go back to the way things were, but she doesn't know how to do that. Then she comes across the word closure--and she realizes this is what she needs. And in her search for it, Caitlin discovers that the world may not be so black and white after all.<br><br><b>"Powerful."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"A strong and complex character study."--<i>The Horn Book</i><br><br>"Allusions to Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, the portrayal of a whole community's healing process, and the sharp insights into Caitlyn's behavior enhance this fine addition to the recent group of books with narrators with autism and Asbergers."--<i>Booklist</i></b></p><p>Kathryn Erskine spent many years as a lawyer before realizing that she&#x2019;d rather write things that people might actually enjoy reading. She grew up mostly overseas and attended eight different schools, her favorite being the Hogwarts-type castle in Scotland. The faculty, of course, did not consist of wizards, although . . . how did the headmistress know that it was &#x201c;the wee redhead&#x201d; who led the campaign to free the mice from the biology lab? Erskine draws on her childhood&#x2014;and her second childhood through her children&#x2014;for her stories. She still loves to travel but nowadays most trips tend to be local, such as basketball and tennis courts, occasional emergency room visits, and the natural food store for very healthy organic chocolate with &#x201c;life saving&#x201d; flavonoids.Grade 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;From inside Caitlin's head, readers see the very personal aftermath of a middle school shooting that took the life of the older brother she adored. Caitlin is a bright fifth grader and a gifted artist. She also has Asperger's syndrome, and her brother, Devon, was the one who helped her interpret the world. Now she has only her father, a widower who is grieving anew and whose ability to relate to his daughter is limited. A compassionate school counselor works with her, trying to teach her the social skills that are so difficult for her. Through her own efforts and her therapy sessions, she begins to come to terms with her loss and makes her first, tentative steps toward friendship. Caitlin's thought processes, including her own brand of logic, are made remarkably clear. The longer readers spend in the child's world, the more understandable her entirely literal and dispassionate interpretations are. Marred slightly by the portrayal of Devon as a perfect being, this is nonetheless a valuable book. After getting to know Caitlin, young people's tendencies to label those around them as either "normal" or "weird" will seem as simplistic and inadequate a system as it truly is.&#x2014;<i>Faith Brautigam, Gail Borden Public Library, Elgin, IL</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

He spent his childhood in the Washington, D.C., area and moved to New England in 1995. Jeff lives with his wife and two sons in Massachusetts, where they own a bookstore, An Unlikely Story.The third book in Kinney&#39;s popular series opens with Greg&#39;s New Year&#39;s resolution: Since he&#39;s already perfect, he&#39;ll focus on helping other people address their character flaws. (And he&#39;s surprised by their negative reactions to his helpful suggestions.) Though some older listeners may tire of the smart-aleck boy humor evident here, narrator Ramon de Ocampo does not: He brings as much energy to his lively characterization of Greg as he did in the first book. De Ocampo&#39;s tone (smart-alecky yet clueless) and his depictions of Greg fumbling his way through playing soccer badly, getting a merit badge in Boy Scouts, and having a first crush are sure to delight the boys who are so clearly Kinney&#39;s audience.

She was a dedicated student with tons of extracurricular activities, friends, and loving parents at home.<br> <br>But after awakening from a vivid nightmare in which she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she was convinced the dream had been a warning. Allison believed that she must do something to stop the cancer in her dream from becoming a reality.<br> <br>It started with avoiding sidewalk cracks and quickly grew to counting steps as loudly as possible. Over the following weeks, her brain listed more dangers and fixes. She had to avoid hair dryers, calculators, cell phones, computers, anything green, bananas, oatmeal, and most of her own clothing.<br> <br>Unable to act &#x201c;normal,&#x201d; the once-popular Allison became an outcast. Her parents questioned her behavior, leading to explosive fights. When notebook paper, pencils, and most schoolbooks were declared dangerous to her health, her GPA imploded, along with her plans for the future.<br> <br>Finally, she allowed herself to ask for help and was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. This brave memoir tracks Allison&#x2019;s descent and ultimately hopeful climb out of the depths.</p><p>Allison Britz graduated with her BA and MA from Wake Forest University. When not spending all of her money on books, she enjoys cooking, three-day weekends, arguing with her OCD, and extensive Netflix binges. She lives in Manhattan with her husband and their dog. <i>Obsessed</i>&nbsp;is her first book."Depicted with affecting honesty (and including quite a lot of dialogue), Allison's journey is at once gripping and agonizing...&nbsp; Readers willing to share Allison's evident pain and humiliation may gain insight into a troubling disorder, but it's the joy of her slow recovery that they'll savor." Author: Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Readers will empathize with Britz, experiencing from her perspective the potential effects of OCD and cheering her along as she steadily improves. An ending note provides encouragement from the author along with a list of resources. VERDICT An important voice in the discussion of OCD." Author: School Library Journal<br><br>"Although nonfiction, the memoir reads like a novel and keeps readers wanting to know more about the complexities of OCD. A hopeful ending chronicles her diagnosis and early treatment." Author: Booklist Online<br><br>"Britz&#x2019;s energetic present-tense narration makes her memoir read like a novel; she brings an immediacy to the intensity of her experiences that invites equal parts sympathy and horror...

The English language, however, has changed over time, and just as there are phrases in the Authorized Version (1611), also known as the King James Version, that are no longer as clear as they once were due to linguistic change, so it is the case with the 1689 Confession. For this reason, this new rendition of the confession by Dr. Reeves is indeed welcome. He has sought to render it readable by the typical twenty-first-century Christian reader, but with minimal change and without sacrificing any of the riches of the original text. I believe he has succeeded admirably in both of these aims. From the Foreword Michael A.G.

She lives in Sag Harbor, New York.Grade 2-4AA fantasy adventure for beginning chapter-book readers. Wiglaf, the would-be hero, lives with his large, brutish family in abject poverty. Their hovel smells worse than their pigsty. Though Wiglaf is the smallest member of the family, he is made to do all the work, and is constantly picked on by the others because he is reluctant to kill any living thing. A traveling minstrel tells Wiglaf's fortune; it shows that he can improve his lot by performing a gallant act. The boy decides to sign up at the local Dragon Slayers' AcademyAit guarantees to make him a hero. However, he finds life at the run-down school as difficult as it is at home, and he protests when he is sent out to slay the local dragon on his first day. When his magic sword doesn't work, he switches to another strategy. He has learned that the dragon can't stand bad jokes so he tries a few and, as predicted, the dragon expires at his feet. Wiglaf is a hero without spilling a single drop of blood. The fast-paced, snappy text is filled with jokes and insults; the accompanying black-and-white illustrations are dark and cartoonlike.

Cows Minnie and Moo return in a gleefully silly, slapstick mystery that is right on target for readers ready for simple chapter books. While picnicking, Minnie notices that her jelly donut has disappeared. When a feather appears next to the empty pastry box, the cow sleuths deduce that the thief must be a chicken. Their investigation takes them to a chicken house, where they end up saving the birds from a hungry fox. The smoothly paced text is filled with dialogue that energetically ping-pongs between animal characters, and children will giggle over the cows' leaps in logic and bumbling sleuthing, illustrated to great effect in candy-colored pictures.

It's time to recover</b>.</p> <p>Most people who suffer from anxiety and panic attacks are told by their well-meaning friends, doctors, therapists and psychiatrists to "manage" their anxiety. Some are prescribed pills in an effort to calm their anxiety down. Breathing techniques, mindfulness and more are advised as well. </p> <p>Needless to say, that isn't a very effective approach, and it never was. </p> <p>Anxiety and panic attacks require a different strategy, a counterintuitive one. &nbsp;Left uncontrolled, anxiety tends to grow more and more because our amygdala (the anxiety center of our brain) becomes hyperactive and sees more and more to worry about.</p> <p>This book will uncover science based and counterintuitive techniques that are designed to end unwanted anxiety and to stop panic attacks. They have been tried and tested both by the author Geert Verschaeve (who suffered from generalized anxiety and panic attacks for fourteen years) and the thousands of people who suffered from anxiety he has helped ever since. </p> <p>The goal of this book is simple:</p> <ul> <li>You'll get step-by-step plans on how to respond and what to think in the anxious situations that still frighten you.</li> <li>You'll learn how to overcome "fear of the fear" and anticipatory anxiety.</li> <li>We'll look at the different sensations anxiety can give to your body and how to deal with them.</li> <li>You'll get a list of ingredients to avoid that increase anxiety and can cause panic attacks.</li> <li>You'll discover how to stop "checking in" all the time, so you can get on with your life.</li> </ul> <p><b>The recovery comes in four stages:</b></p> <p>The first stage you will reach is the one where your intolerance to anxiety will be gone. You'll be participating in whatever it is that currently still makes you uncomfortable. You'll still feel some anxiety, but for many reasons that will become clear when you get there, the anxiety won't bother you. The fear of the fear will be gone.</p> <p>Stage two appears when you'll partake in something that previously gave you anxiety, and you'll realize the anxiety and the accompanying sensations simply aren't there. Your anxiety may not be linked to locations or events, and in that case you'll just notice that you haven't had to think of your anxiety for some time. No checking in was needed. </p> <p>This will be a very liberating moment, as I'm sure you can imagine. </p> <p>Then, stage three arises. As you start to enjoy many activities again and can finally go on with your life, you'll arrive at a point where you will become aware of what's been happening: "huh...I haven't felt anxious for a long time. I don't even remember when the last time was. I've really been enjoying life again. Is it all really in the past now?" </p> <p>Then comes a very important moment, stage four. This may be months or even years down the road. The moment that the anxiety tries to return. It will. Up until that instant you may have been living your life fully, with clear skies and sunshine every day. Then, a little cloud of anxiety tries to appear. That may sound scary, for now. However, since by that time you'll have finished this entire book, you'll know exactly how to respond and the anxiety won't take over. It won't be able to, because you cannot unlearn what you're about to learn. It will be like seeing a long lost "friend" passing by, making you remember of the past, without going back to it.</p> <p><b>Are you ready to become a fearless badass?

The result of research conducted on two fronts--conservation and curatorial--the catalogue offers a reconsideration of the cut-outs by exploring a host of technical and conceptual issues: the artist&#x2019;s methods and materials and the role and function of the works in his practice; their economy of means and exploitation of decorative strategies; their environmental aspects; and their double lives, first as contingent and mutable in the studio and ultimately made permanent, a transformation accomplished via mounting and framing. Richly illustrated to present the cut-outs in all of their vibrancy and luminosity, the book includes an introduction and a conservation essay that consider the cut-outs from new theoretical and technical perspectives, and five thematic essays, each focusing on a different moment in the development of the cut-out practice, that provide a chronicle of this radical medium&#x2019;s unfolding, and period photographs that show the works in process in Matisse&#x2019;s studio.<br><br>One of modern art&#x2019;s towering figures, <b>Henri Matisse</b> (1869&#x2013;1954) was a painter, draftsman, sculptor and printmaker before turning to paper cut-outs in the 1940s.

Yet, this book, with its oversize format, brief, informative text, and large illustrations, will be a first choice for many children.

Several spectacular images depict the ship's going down after its rendezvous with the iceberg. Some of the text sweeps around the outer edges of the pages, which means children will need to turn the book around in order to read the words--no easy task given the book's size.

Its pictures are sure to snare the substantial audience interested in the history of swords, guns, and body armor. Limiting the subject to portable armaments, the work extends from the first likely weapon (a rock) to the rifles issued to contemporary infantrymen. In most cases, the emphasis is on the tools of the ordinary soldier, his equipage through time explained with arrowed illustrations. The evolution of handheld weaponry is soon apparent, with that of firearms especially prominent. Some guns depicted here will be recognizable (think AK-47) even to those who recoil from guns. Explaining how such lethal equipment works is <i>Weapon</i>'s forte; another asset is the comparison of weapon categories across a suite of historical societies. Popular?

She may feel guilty, ashamed, angry, depressed, confused, or alone.<br><br>With vulnerability and tenderness, Adriel Booker shares intimate stories about her experiences with miscarriage to help you navigate your own grief and know you aren't alone. She tackles complex questions about faith, suffering, and God's will with sensitivity and clarity, devoid of religious clich�s or pat answers. Ultimately, Adriel invites you to a wide-open place of grace, honesty, and genuine hope as you discover a redemption story unfolding in the shadows of your loss. She also includes practical resources for ways to help guide children through grief, advice on pregnancy after loss, and special sections for dads and loved ones.</p><p>"Adriel writes with the authority of one who has endured suffering. She is a gifted teacher and a brave leader into the darker realms of faith. As she discusses the transformation that grief brings into our lives, she also acknowledges and then shoos away blame, comparison, false guilt, shame, and isolation. Though it's been years since I've experienced miscarriage, this book helped me remember and even shined a light into other areas of suffering that I hardly know how to address."<br>--<b>Amber C. Haines</b>, author of <i>Wild in the Hollow</i>, from the foreword<br>&nbsp;<br>"When I experienced the loss of a pregnancy I wanted two things in that place of pain. First, to know that I was not alone in it. Second, to believe there was hope. Adriel Booker offers both in Grace Like Scarlett.

(25-pack)</h2><p><p>HOW CAN WE KNOW WE'LL GO TO HEAVEN? </p> <p>A recent poll indicated that for every American who believes he or she is going to hell, there are 120 who believe they're going to heaven. </p> <p>This optimism stands in stark contrast to Jesus Christ's words written in the Bible: "Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few" (Matthew 7:13-14).</p> <p>The truth is that according to the Bible we don't automatically go to heaven. In fact, hell--not heaven--is our default destination. Unless our sin problem is solved once and for all, we can't enter heaven. That's the bad news. </p> <p>But once that's straight in our minds we're ready to hear the good news of Jesus Christ. Jesus took upon himself, on the cross, the hell we deserve so that we could experience for eternity the heaven we don't deserve! </p> <p><strong><em>THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS </em></strong></p> <p>There are two possible destinations when we die: heaven or hell. Can we really know in advance where we'll go? John, one of the writers of the Bible, said this: "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life" (1 John 5:13). </p> <p>We can know for sure that we'll go to heaven when we die. Do you? </p> <p>To sin means to fall short of God's holy standards. Sin is what ended paradise in the Garden of Eden. And all of us, like Adam and Eve, are sinners. "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). Sin separates us from a relationship with God (Isaiah 59:2) and it deceives us and makes us think that wrong is right and right is wrong (Proverbs 14:12). Sin has terrible consequences, but God has provided a solution: "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23). </p> <p>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, loved us so much that he left the riches of heaven to become a man and deliver us from our sin. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16). He came to identify with us in our humanity and our weakness, but he did so without being tainted by our sin, self-deception, and moral failings (Hebrews 4:15-16). Jesus died on the cross as the only one worthy to pay the penalty for our sins demanded by the holiness of God: "For our sake he [God] made him [Jesus] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:21). But in victory over death, God raised Jesus from the grave, defeating the consequences of sin (1 Corinthians 15:3-4, 54-57). </p> <p>When Christ died on the cross for us, he said, "It is finished" (John 19:30). In those times "It is finished" was commonly written across certificates of debt when they were canceled. It meant "Paid in full." Christ died so that the certificate of debt consisting of all our sins could once and for all be marked "Paid in full." </p> <p><strong><em>THE CRITICAL DECISION</em></strong></p> <p>Only when our sins are dealt with in Christ can we enter heaven. </p> <p> </p> <p>We cannot pay our own way. Jesus said, "No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). Because of Jesus Christ's sacrificial death on the cross on our behalf, God freely offers us forgiveness. </p> <p>To be forgiven, we must recognize and repent of our sins. Forgiveness is not automatic. It's conditioned upon confession: "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). Christ offers to everyone the gifts of forgiveness, salvation, and eternal life. "Let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price" (Revelation 22:17). </p> <p>There's no righteous deed we can do that will earn us a place in heaven (Titus 3:5). We come to Christ empty-handed. We can take no credit for salvation. "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9). This gift cannot be worked for, earned, or achieved. It's dependent solely on Christ's generous sacrifice on our behalf. </p> <p>Now is the time to make things right with God. Confess your sinfulness and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on your behalf. </p> <p>You are made for a person and a place. Jesus is the person, and heaven is the place. They are a package-- they come together. You cannot get heaven without Jesus or Jesus without heaven. "Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near" (Isaiah 55:6). For all eternity you'll be glad you did. </p> <p>If you understand what God has done to make forgiveness and eternal life possible for you, you may want to express it in words like these: "Dear Lord, I confess that I do not measure up to your perfect standard. Thank you for sending Jesus to die for my sins. I now place my trust in him as my Savior. Thank you for your forgiveness and the gift of eternal life." </p></p><p><p><strong>Randy Alcorn </strong>(MA, Multnomah University) is the founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries and a <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of over fifty books.

He lives with his family in Alhambra, California.K-Gr 2-In this fractured fairy tale, three little pigs are portrayed as frustrated siblings fed up with a wolf that loves to huff and puff and blow houses down. In an attempt to protect their homes in their Japanese village, they train at a Ninja school. As the first brother begins aikido lessons, he finds himself bored and drops out, which gives him little defense when the wolf comes to call. Pig Two attempts his skill at jujitsu but his confidence is larger than his capabilities, and he is no match for the villain. Their sister is the only one who studies well and practices until she masters karate. When the wolf arrives at her door, she settles the score and sends him running. Learning a lesson from their gutsy sister, the brothers return to their classes with more determination and success. Unlike the original tale, the pigs are given responsibility for their misfortune and a chance for improvement. The story has a clear message that success requires perseverance. The text and glossary include martial-arts terms. Santat's artwork is in manga style and has wonderful depictions of Japanese scenery and architecture. The pigs are full of motion and emotion as they train and battle with the wolf. Youngsters with an interest in martial arts and those seeking strong female characters will relish this picture book.-Diane Antezzo, Ridgefield Library, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

About what it&#x2019;s like growing up on the levee in Stockton, where every other person you meet has missing teeth or is leaning against a liquor store wall begging for change to buy beer. Or maybe it&#x2019;d be about my dad dying in the stupid war and how at the funeral they gave my mom some cheap medal and a folded flag and shot a bunch of rifles at the clouds. Or maybe the book would just be something about me and my brother, Diego. How we hang mostly by ourselves, pulling corroded-looking fish out of the murky levee water and throwing them back. How sometimes when Moms falls asleep in front of the TV we&#x2019;ll sneak out of the apartment and walk around the neighborhood, looking into other people&#x2019;s windows, watching them sleep.<br><br>That&#x2019;s the weirdest thing, by the way. That every person you come across lays down in a bed, under the covers, and closes their eyes at night. Cops, teachers, parents, hot girls, pro ballers, everybody. For some reason it makes people seem so much less real when I look at them.<br><br>Anyways, at first I was worried standing there next to the hunchback old man they gave me for a lawyer, both of us waiting for the judge to make his verdict. I thought maybe they&#x2019;d put me away for a grip of years because of what I did. But then I thought real hard about it. I squinted my eyes and concentrated with my whole mind. That&#x2019;s something you don&#x2019;t know about me. I can sometimes make stuff happen just by thinking about it. I try not to do it too much because my head mostly gets stuck on bad stuff, but this time something good actually happened: the judge only gave me a year in a group home. Said I had to write in a journal so some counselor could try to figure out how I think. Dude didn&#x2019;t know I was probably gonna write a book anyways. Or that it&#x2019;s hard as hell bein&#x2019; at home these days, after what happened. So when he gave out my sentence it was almost like he didn&#x2019;t give me a sentence at all.<br><br>I told my moms the same thing when we were walking out of the courtroom together. I said, &#x201c;Yo, Ma, this isn&#x2019;t so bad, right? I thought those people would lock me up and throw away the key.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t say anything back, though. Didn&#x2019;t look at me either. Matter of fact, she didn&#x2019;t look at me all the way up till the day she had to drive me to Juvenile Hall, drop me off at the gate, where two big beefy white guards were waiting to escort me into the building. And even then she just barely glanced at me for a split second. And we didn&#x2019;t hug or anything. Her face seemed plain, like it would on any other day. I tried to look at her real good as we stood there. I knew I wasn&#x2019;t gonna see her for a while. Her skin was so much whiter than mine and her eyes were big and blue. And she was wearing the fake diamond earrings she always wears that sparkle when the sun hits &#x2019;em at a certain angle. Her blond hair all pulled back in a ponytail.<br><br>For some reason it hit me hard right then&#x2014;as one of the guards took me by the arm and started leading me away&#x2014;how mad pretty my mom is. For real, man, it&#x2019;s like someone&#x2019;s picture you&#x2019;d see in one of them magazines laying around the dentist&#x2019;s office. Or on a TV show. And she&#x2019;s actually my moms.<br><br>I looked over my shoulder as they walked me through the gate, but she still wasn&#x2019;t looking at me. It&#x2019;s okay, though. I understood why.<br><br>It&#x2019;s &#x2019;cause of what I did.<br><br>June 1<br><br>I&#x2019;ll put it to you like this: I&#x2019;m about ten times smarter than everyone in Juvi. For real. These guys are a bunch of straight-up dummies, man. Take this big black kid they put me in a cell with, Rondell. He can&#x2019;t even read. I know &#x2019;cause three nights ago he stepped to me when I was writing in my journal. He said: &#x201c;Yo, Mexico, wha&#x2019;chu writin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout in there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever I wanna write about,&#x201d; I said without looking up. &#x201c;How &#x2019;bout them apples, homey?&#x201d;<br><br>He paused. &#x201c;What you just said?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head, told him: &#x201c;And Mexico&#x2019;s a pretty stupid thing to call me, by the way, considering I&#x2019;ve never even been to Mexico.&#x201d;<br><br>His ass stood there a quick sec, thinking about what I&#x2019;d just said to him&#x2014;or at least trying. Then he bum-rushed me. Shoved me right off my chair and onto the ground, pressed his giant grass-stained shoe down on my neck. He said: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you never talk like that to Rondell again. You hear? Nobody talk to Rondell like that.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to nod, but he had my neck pinned, so I couldn&#x2019;t really move my head. Couldn&#x2019;t make a sound either. Or breathe too good.<br><br>He swiped my journal off the table and stared at the page I was writing, his kick weighing down on my neck. And I&#x2019;m not gonna lie, man, I got a little spooked. Rondell&#x2019;s a freak for a sixteen-year-old: six foot something with huge-ass arms and legs and a face that already looks like he&#x2019;s a grown man. And I&#x2019;d just written some pretty bad stuff about him in my journal. Called him a retarded ape who smelled like when a rat dies in the wall of your apartment. But at the same time I almost wanted Rondell to push down harder with his shoe. Almost wanted him to crush my neck, break my windpipe, end my stupid-ass journal right then and there. I started imagining the shoe pushing all the way through, rubber hitting cement. Them telling my moms what happened as she stood with the phone cupped to her ear in the kitchen, crying but at the same time looking sort of relieved, too.<br><br>After a couple minutes like that&#x2014;Rondell staring at the page I&#x2019;d been writing and me pinned to the nasty cement floor of our cell&#x2014;he tossed the journal back on the table and took his foot off my neck.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s how I knew he couldn&#x2019;t read.

They&#x2019;re the lowest-ranked basketball team in their league, and they live in the poorest neighborhood in Dren. Nobody expects them to succeed at anything. Plus, every kid on the team has secret struggles of his own.<br>When a new coach named Professor Wizenard arrives on the first day of training camp, the Badgers can&#x2019;t explain the magical-seeming things they see and hear. Every player experiences unique and strange visions&#x2015;visions that challenge everything they thought they knew about basketball, and about their lives and their secrets off the court.

That is until one summer when a new coach gives them the chance to change everything. Rolabi Wizenard and his magical coaching techniques cover offense, defense, individual strengths and weaknesses, and physical conditioning. Through basketball, he shows his players that working at each of these will not only make them stronger physically, but also mentally and emotionally.The Badgers players - Rain, Twig, Cash, Lab, and Pe�o - each have their own story, their own challenges, and their own fears. Over the course of a two-week basketball camp, we get to know each character and their struggles, where they&#39;ve come from, and where they are going.Each story teaches readers empathy, the understanding that there are multiple sides to every story, and that accepting our differences will help us become better friends as well as better athletes.<b>Kobe Bryant</b> is an Academy Award&#x2013;winning storyteller and content creator.

This was not my intention. I meant to grow flowers out of the ground, like any normal person would. But I&#x2019;ve never been normal, and magic is unpredictable, finicky, and dangerous, especially in the wrong hands.<br><br> Granny had taught me magic from the cradle. Some grandmothers shower their grandbabies with cuddles and kisses and gumdrops. I got enchantments and spells and potions. Granny knew spells to conjure rain and wind, charms to make things grow or shrink, and enchantments of disguise and trickery. She could brew a potion to clear your mind or clear your stuffy nose. She had elixirs for toothaches, bellyaches, and heartaches, and a special balm for bottom itch. There was no end to the wonders of magic.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was also no end to the troubles.<br><br> When I was five years old, I wanted to grow red roses for Granny&#x2019;s birthday. Roses, because her name is Rose, and red, because my name is Red. They would be the per- fect gift. I knew I could do it. I had seen Granny grow fat orange pumpkins and juicy red berries straight out of the ground with just a wave of her hands and a few words.<br><br> I chose my own words with care.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Red Rose Charm</b><br> Sprout and blossom, red, red <br> rose Let your fragrance fill <br> my nose<br> &nbsp;<br> I felt the tingle of the magic in my fingertips. I gave a flourish of the arm, a flick of the hand, just as Granny did, but nothing happened. I tried again. I spoke louder, flourished grander, and...<br><br> A red rose exploded out of my right nostril.<br><br> I tried to rub the rose off, but that only made me sneeze, and another rose shot out of my left nostril.<br><br> Granny could not stop laughing. You might even say she cackled.<br><br> &#x201c;Granny! Do some-ding!&#x201d; I sobbed through the roses. I expected her to wave her hands and make the roses disappear. Instead, she ripped them right out of my nose.<br><br> &#x201c;Aaaaouch!&#x201d; I screamed.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you for the roses,&#x201d; said Granny, placing them in a vase on her table. &#x201c;We can call them booger blossoms.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Achoo!&#x201d; I replied.<br> &nbsp;<br> Granny laughed for a full five minutes. I sneezed for five hours.<br><br> I&#x2019;ll admit, it was sort of funny, even if it did hurt worse than pixie bites. But I worried that this might be an omen&#x2014;that the magic was somehow wrong inside me. After the booger blossoms, I decided to stick to practical magic, such as a drying spell. I&#x2019;d seen Granny do this countless times: just a snap of her fingers and she&#x2019;d have dripping laundry dry in minutes.<br><br> But when I snapped my fingers, no wind came. Just fire. Yes, fire, as in flames. Flaming skirts and blouses and undergarments. In less than a minute, they were cinders and ash.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re certainly dry,&#x201d; said Granny.<br><br> When I was six, I had a friend named Gertie. We were only allowed to play at her house with constant supervision from her mother, Helga. Helga was always worried. She worried Gertie would fall in a well or off a cliff. She worried Gertie would choke on her morning mush. She worried trolls would come in the night and carry Gertie away for their supper. This worrying became problematic when I wanted to take Gertie into The Woods to play.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother says I&#x2019;ll be eaten by wolves,&#x201d; Gertie said. <br><br> &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been eaten by wolves, and I play in The Woods all the time.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever get lost? Mother is always afraid I&#x2019;ll lose my way.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m never lost. I have a magic path.&#x201d; Gertie&#x2019;s eyes got as big as apples. Magic was rare, and my path was something special. It only appeared when I wanted it to, and it led me wherever I wanted to go in The Woods. Surely this would entice Gertie to come with me, but it didn&#x2019;t. She stepped away from me. Her eyes grew wary.<br><br> &#x201c;Mother says magic is dangerous.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My path isn&#x2019;t dangerous,&#x201d; I said with indignation. &#x201c;Granny made it to keep me safe. She made it grow right out of the ground after a bear attacked me and I almost died.&#x201d; I thought this would impress her. The possibility of death was always exciting, and being able to defy it with magic was even better.<br><br> &#x201c;Mother says your granny is a witch,&#x201d; said Gertie.<br><br> Of course Granny was a witch. I knew that, but Gertie said it like it was a bad thing. Desperation took hold of me. I really wanted to play with Gertie in The Woods. So I did the only sensible thing I could think of. I cast the Worrywart Spell on Gertie&#x2019;s mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Worrywart Spell</b><br> Worry&#x2019;s a wart upon your chin<br>It spreads and grows from deep within<br>Make the wart shrink day by day <br> Send your worries far away<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, the spell did nothing to cure Helga&#x2019;s worries. Instead, she grew a wart on her chin. The wart grew steadily bigger, day by day, until Granny was summoned to remedy my mistake. Needless to say, I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to play with Gertie anymore&#x2014;or anyone else&#x2014;for, in addition to being a worrywart, Helga was also the village gossip. The news spread all over The Mountain.<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a witch,&#x201d; Helga told the villagers, &#x201c;just like her grandmother.&#x201d; She seemed to forget it was Granny who had cured her.<br><br> Gertie stopped talking to me, and no one else would even look at me. The magic in me grew hot and sticky. It coated my throat. It stung my eyes. I wished I could swallow it down and make it disappear.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Red,&#x201d; Granny told me. &#x201c;We all make mistakes. When I was your age, I tried to summon a rabbit to be my pet, and instead I called a bear to the door!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;How did you survive?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The bear was actually quite nice. My sister married him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She married a bear?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. He wasn&#x2019;t really a bear. He was a prince under a spell.&#x201d;<br><br> This did nothing to alleviate my concerns. I didn&#x2019;t want to marry a bear or a prince.<br> &#x201c;All the magic I do is bad,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;Nonsense, child,&#x201d; said Granny. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re only mistakes. It takes a hundred miles of mistakes before you arrive at your own true magic.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But what if my mistakes are too big?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No such thing, dear,&#x201d; said Granny.<br><br> But she was wrong. I went on trying spells and charms and potions, and I went on making mistakes. Big ones. Small ones. Deadly ones.<br><br> My last mistake was worse than warts, fire, or roses out the nose.</p><h2>Wilder Boys</h2><p>Two brothers need all their wilderness skills to survive when they set off into the woods of Wyoming in search of their absent father.<br><br>Jake and Taylor Wilder have been taking care of themselves for a long time. Their father abandoned the family years ago, and their mother is too busy working and running interference between the boys and her boyfriend, Bull, to spend a lot of time with them. Thirteen-year-old Jake spends most of his time reading. He pores over his father&#x2019;s journal, which is full of wilderness facts and survival tips. Eleven-year-old Taylor likes to be outside playing with their dog, Cody, or joking around with the other kids in the neighborhood.<br> <br>But one night everything changes. The boys discover a dangerous secret that Bull is hiding.<br> <br>And the next day, they come home from school to find their mother unconscious in an ambulance. Afraid that their mom is dead and fearing for their own safety, the Wilder Boys head off in search of their father. They only have his old letters and journal to help them, but they bravely venture onward.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a long journey from the suburbs of Pittsburgh to the wilderness of Wyoming; can the Wilder Boys find their father before Bull catches up with them?</p><p>Trekking solo across the remotest corners of Wyoming and Montana as a young man, Brandon Wallace learned how to survive the hard way in the harshest conditions nature could throw at him. Having spent the subsequent two decades as a trail leader, passing on his knowledge to a generation of budding adventurers, he turned his hand to fictionalizing his experiences, and the Wilder Boys series was born.Wilder Boys <br>1 Splashing through murky pools of rainwater by the side of the road, the mud-splattered school bus rumbled to a stop. With an eager leap, Jake and his younger brother, Taylor, rose from their seats.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last day of school tomorrow.&#x201d; Taylor grinned at the bus driver as he reached the door. &#x201c;What are you gonna do without us?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Polanachek grunted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get some peace and quiet, that&#x2019;s what!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, admit it,&#x201d; Taylor said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna miss us, aren&#x2019;t ya?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I&#x2019;d miss this ulcer you kids been givin&#x2019; me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake nudged his brother from behind. &#x201c;Quit being a pain, Taylor. You&#x2019;re making everyone late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Taylor laughed and hopped down the bus steps. &#x201c;See ya tomorrow, Mr. Polanachek! Don&#x2019;t forget to bring your ulcer with you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake jumped down beside him on the gravel-strewn side of the road. &#x201c;Do you even know what an ulcer is, Taylor?&#x201d;<br> <br>Taylor ran his fingers through his wavy light brown hair and rolled his eyes up at Jake. At thirteen, Jake was only two years older than his brother, but that didn&#x2019;t stop him acting like he was a know-it-all adult sometimes. However, before Taylor could answer, the boys heard a sharp high-pitched bark and saw a brown-and-white flash streaking toward them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cody!&#x201d; Taylor shouted, and squatted down to let the Jack Russell terrier leap into his arms. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s our boy?&#x201d;<br> <br>The dog squirmed happily in Taylor&#x2019;s grasp and plastered slobber across his cheek.<br> <br>Jake laughed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s right on time!&#x201d; Cody danced around the boys&#x2019; feet as if they&#x2019;d been away for years, rather than a few hours. He always seemed to know the exact time they&#x2019;d return from school.<br> <br>As they did every day, the two brothers and Cody turned down a side street into their neighborhood, strolling home to check on their mom. Taylor happily splashed through puddles in the broken sidewalk and kicked a rock toward a peeling yellow fire hydrant that had been almost completely swallowed by weeds.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe tomorrow is the last day of school!&#x201d; Taylor exclaimed. &#x201c;Man, I can&#x2019;t wait. I&#x2019;m just gonna sleep in, play baseball, and forget about homework. Hey! Maybe you and me can go fishin&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake raised an eyebrow at him. &#x201c;Fishing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not? Dad taught you, didn&#x2019;t he? I mean, before he left?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, sort of, but we don&#x2019;t have any gear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can get some.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How? Do you have money to buy fishing tackle?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe Bull will get it for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Taylor, get real.&#x201d; Jake huffed as the blast of a train whistle sounded from the freight yards down by the river. &#x201c;When&#x2019;s the last time Bull bought us anything?&#x201d;<br> <br>Taylor shrugged. &#x201c;It was just an idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake kept quiet. The truth was, thinking about summer made his stomach feel like it was filled with gravel. Even though his school wasn&#x2019;t exactly a five-star academy, Jake loved going there every day. He often spent lunch period in the library, devouring books. He hung out mostly in the action-adventure section, but he would read almost anything else in the library too. School was the one place he didn&#x2019;t have to worry about Mom or her psychotic boyfriend, Bull.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Taylor blurted, pulling Jake from his thoughts. &#x201c;Check it out!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake halted and followed Taylor&#x2019;s pointed finger, sweeping his dark hair away from his eyes. A brilliant yellow-and-black bird perched on a telephone wire less than thirty feet from where they stood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Geez, you ever seen one like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jake admitted. Crows, pigeons, and sparrows ruled the area around their neighborhood. He recognized all of them, but there was normally never anything this flashy. &#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ll find it in the book Mom gave us,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s look it up when we get home.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the boys approached the neighborhood church, they spotted a black-and-white police cruiser parked on the street. Jake recognized the large, familiar shape of Officer Grasso.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Officer Grasso!&#x201d; Taylor shouted. &#x201c;How many bad guys you catch today?&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman grinned. &#x201c;Not enough, as usual. How you boys doing? Only one more day of school, huh? You looking forward to summer?&#x201d;<br> <br>Taylor gave an exaggerated sigh. &#x201c;You can say that again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake just nodded. Both he and his brother liked the policeman. Once or twice a week, Officer Grasso would park here, a toothpick in his mouth, to greet the kids coming home from school. The neighborhood had a reputation for petty crime and drug use, and the policeman knew it made people feel safer to see him around.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you going to do with all your free time?&#x201d; Officer Grasso asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We were just talkin&#x2019; about that,&#x201d; said Taylor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna play baseball, and me and Jake are goin&#x2019; fishing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fishing, huh? Good idea. When I was a kid, the rivers around here were so dirty from the factories, we didn&#x2019;t dare go near &#x2019;em. Now I hear they hold bass tournaments in them!&#x201d;<br> <br>While Taylor tossed a stick for Cody, Officer Grasso lowered his voice and turned to Jake, asking, &#x201c;Say, you seen Bull lately?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, he&#x2019;s been around,&#x201d; Jake answered. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>The officer had asked the question casually, but Jake picked up an undercurrent beneath his words. Jake had to be careful with these kinds of situations. The fact was, he was afraid of Bull, but he couldn&#x2019;t let anyone know anything was wrong&#x2014;least of all the cops. Although he would have liked nothing better than to see his mom&#x2019;s boyfriend thrown in jail, Jake knew that if he took a wrong step, Bull would come after him. Even worse, he might go after Taylor or their mom.<br> <br>The policemen shrugged. &#x201c;Oh, nothing, really. There was an, uh, incident last night not far from here. I thought maybe Bull might know something about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Or did it himself, Jake thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did anyone get hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>The officer lifted his hat, ran his hand over his thick sandy hair, and replaced the hat. &#x201c;Not this time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Bull was home with us last night,&#x201d; Jake lied. &#x201c;I doubt he&#x2019;d know anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before the policeman could ask anything else, Jake said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better go check on our mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>Officer Grasso seemed unconvinced, but he let the boys go. &#x201c;Okay. You take care now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You too,&#x201d; said Jake, continuing down the street. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Taylor. Cody.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake felt dread in the pit of his stomach. He hated lying to Officer Grasso, but he couldn&#x2019;t take any chances where Bull was concerned. He had to keep his family safe. Jake and Taylor had lived in this neighborhood for the last seven years, ever since their father left. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly mansion heights, but it was still a tight community. Gossip spread quickly. About four blocks deep by ten blocks long, the neighborhood was lined by simple clapboard houses that had seen better days. For Jake and Taylor, it wasn&#x2019;t much, but it was home.<br> <br>A couple of houses down the boys passed the peach-colored house belonging to Mrs. Sanchez. As usual at this time of year, Mrs. Sanchez busied herself in the front yard, tending her small vegetable garden.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Mrs. Sanchez,&#x201d; Jake greeted her.<br> <br>She straightened her back, wincing slightly from arthritis. &#x201c;Oh, hi, boys. How are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Taylor and Cody hurried over to her. &#x201c;Anything comin&#x2019; up yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean apart from your bean pole of a brother?&#x201d; Mrs. Sanchez flashed a wry smile at Jake, who was starting to look a lot older than his thirteen years. &#x201c;Well, yes, as a matter of fact.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Sanchez pointed to a half dozen fat twin leaves that had just poked up out of the ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cool! What are they?&#x201d; Taylor asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you remember? I showed them to you last year,&#x201d; said Mrs. Sanchez. &#x201c;Take a guess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, carrots?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope. Jake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm . . .&#x201d; Jake had seen the plants before, and he knew the answer was lodged somewhere in his brain. Finally he said, &#x201c;Squash?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Sanchez beamed. &#x201c;Very good. Just for that, I&#x2019;ll let you have the first one that gets ripe!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw,&#x201d; Taylor said, disappointed.<br> <br>Jake punched him in the shoulder. &#x201c;If you quit being such a pain, I might even share.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Sanchez laughed, then said, &#x201c;Jake, how is your mom doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Taylor answered for him. &#x201c;The nice weather&#x2019;s making her feel like her old self.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jake knew that wasn&#x2019;t exactly the truth, but he didn&#x2019;t see any point in contradicting his younger brother.<br> <br>Mrs. Sanchez nodded. &#x201c;Well, you let me know if there&#x2019;s anything I can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks!&#x201d;<br> <br>At the end of the block, the boys approached their own place&#x2014;a small house about twice as big as Mrs. Sanchez&#x2019;s. Unfortunately, it was twice as shabby, too&#x2014;at least since their mom had gotten sick. White paint peeled like dead skin from the wooden siding, while the wooden slats of the fence had begun to fall off one by one. Every year, Bull promised to get the place fixed up and painted, but like most of Bull&#x2019;s promises, this one never amounted to anything.<br> <br>Maybe I&#x2019;ll just do it myself this summer, Jake thought as he pulled open the screen door and entered the house.<br> <br>The boys let their book-filled packs plunk to the floor, and then they tiptoed back to check on their mom. The dusty, yellowed blinds were drawn in her room, but even in the dim light, Jake could make out his mother&#x2019;s sleeping form and hear her ragged breath. A dozen orange vials of pills, half of them with their caps off, sat on the small table next to her bed.<br> <br>Their mom, Jennifer, had never told the boys exactly what was wrong with her, but Jake had overheard the words depression and anxiety. It had started four years earlier, about the time Bull had shown up. Since then she&#x2019;d grown steadily worse. First she&#x2019;d had to quit her job at the bank. Then she stopped being able to go out. For the last year she&#x2019;d spent most of her time in bed.<br> <br>For the millionth time, Jake wondered how different it might have been if their father, Abe Wilder, had stuck around. And for the millionth time, anger boiled up inside him. If their father hadn&#x2019;t been so selfish, Bull wouldn&#x2019;t be in their lives. Most of all, their mother might not be sick.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; Taylor said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if there&#x2019;s anything to eat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Shaking off his anger, Jake followed his younger brother into the kitchen. Taylor yanked open the refrigerator. &#x201c;Whoa! Look here!&#x201d;<br> <br>Usually, the fridge held nothing but Bull&#x2019;s beer and maybe a half-empty ketchup bottle. Today a fresh pack of hot dogs sat on the middle shelf.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like Bull used mom&#x2019;s food stamps to buy some real food for once,&#x201d; Jake said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw &#x2019;em first!&#x201d;<br> <br>Taylor grabbed the package and tore it open. He shoved one of the cold hot dogs into his mouth and gave another one to Cody.<br> <br>Just then the boys heard the front screen door open, followed by heavy footsteps. A moment later the scraggly, unshaved face of their mother&#x2019;s boyfriend appeared in the kitchen door. Jake&#x2019;s stomach dropped as Bull&#x2019;s gray eyes flashed toward him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Bull,&#x201d; Taylor said. &#x201c;Thanks for getting us the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Bull&#x2019;s face contorted with rage. &#x201c;What do ya think you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019;? Those franks aren&#x2019;t for you punks. And they&#x2019;re especially not for your mangy mutt!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bull kicked at Cody, but the dog deftly leaped to the side, cowering from the stocky, barrel-chested brute standing over him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave him alone!&#x201d; Taylor hollered. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t do anything to you!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s eating my food!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Taylor . . .,&#x201d; Jake began, trying to calm his brother. Jake knew that once Taylor got going, there wasn&#x2019;t much that could stop him. Even though fights with Bull only ever ended one way.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s our mom&#x2019;s money that bought this food!&#x201d; Taylor shouted at Bull. &#x201c;Cody can have as much as he wants!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better watch your mouth,&#x201d; Bull snarled, stepping forward.<br> <br>Taylor didn&#x2019;t back down; instead he puffed his chest out and glared up at Bull, his green eyes flashing. &#x201c;Why? You&#x2019;re not even part of this family! If our dad were here, he&#x2019;d kick you out on your butt!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bull&#x2019;s face grew even redder, all the way up his veiny forehead to the roots of his slicked-back hair. &#x201c;Thank God, I ain&#x2019;t your dad. Your dad was a worthless loser, and crazy, too! What kind of man would leave his kids and his sick wife to go chase some crazy daydream?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t sick before you came along!&#x201d; Taylor shouted back. &#x201c;You made her sick. You make me sick. You steal and cheat and . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Bull took another step forward. &#x201c;Why, you lyin&#x2019; little&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Bull raised his hand to strike Taylor, his sinewy forearm slick with sweat.<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Jake shouted, leaping in front of Bull&#x2019;s arm as it began to swing. The blow caught Jake flush on the cheek, knocking him to the floor. Cody began barking furiously. Jake saw purple spots but struggled to get back up, afraid Bull would strike Taylor next. However, instead of continuing the attack, Bull just glared at the two boys.<br> <br>&#x201c;You thieving little punks. If it wasn&#x2019;t for your . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Bull didn&#x2019;t finish the sentence. Instead he spun around and stormed out of the house, tearing off the screen door as he left.</p><h2>Pharmacology (Quick Study Academic)</h2><p><p>Drug fundamentals, plus the most frequently prescribed drug classifications - including indications, reactions, examples &amp; more.</p> <p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Little Book of Energy Healing Techniques: Simple Practices to Heal Body, Mind, and Spirit</h2><p><p><strong>Discover energy healing&#x2015;find more balance and peace.</strong></p><p>Energy healing is the practice of manipulating the subtle energy flow in your body to improve the way you think and feel. <em>The Little Book of Energy Healing Techniques</em> is your introduction to the basics of energy healing, featuring a series of simple exercises you can do anytime.</p><p>Heal your mind, body, and spirit, with clear and balanced energy that empowers you to live with greater peace and comfort.</p><p><em>The Little Book of Energy Healing Techniques</em> allows you to:</p><ul><li><strong>Start from scratch</strong>&#x2015;Practice the exercises in this book right away&#x2015;no prior knowledge required.</li><li><strong>Try it on for size</strong>&#x2015;From sound healing to crystals, you can test out multiple types of energy healing and find what resonates with you.</li><li><strong>Learn active healing</strong>&#x2015;Learn 5- to 15-minute daily routines for centering yourself to alleviate pain and inner turmoil.</li></ul><p>See for yourself what the power of energy healing can do for you.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t my first adventure into the field of energy healing.

Success means personal prosperity: a fine home, vacations, travel, new things, financial security, giving your children maximum advantages. Success means winning admiration, leadership, being looked up to by people in your business and social life. Success means freedom: freedom from worries, fears, frustrations, and failure. Success means self-respect, continually finding more real happiness and satisfaction from life, being able to do more for those who depend on you. </p><p> Success means winning. </p><p> Success -- achievement -- is the goal of life! </p><p> Every human being wants success. Everybody wants the best this life can deliver. Nobody enjoys crawling, living in mediocrity. No one likes feeling second-class and feeling forced to go that way. </p><p> Some of the most practical success-building wisdom is found in that Biblical quotation stating that faith can move mountains. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can move a mountain and you can. Not many people believe that they can move mountains. So, as a result, not many people do. </p><p> On some occasion you've probably heard someone say something like, "It's nonsense to think you can make a mountain move away just by saying 'Mountain, move away.' It's simply impossible." </p><p> People who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking. And true enough, you can't <i>wish</i> away a mountain. You can't <i>wish</i> yourself into an executive suite. Nor can you wish yourself into a five-bedroom, three-bath house or the high-income brackets. You can't wish yourself into a position of leadership. </p><p> But you <i>can</i> move a mountain with belief. You <i>can</i> win success by believing you can succeed. </p><p> There is nothing magical nor mystical about the power of belief. </p><p> Belief works this way. Belief, the "I'm-positive-I-can" attitude, generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do. When you believe I-can-do-it, the <i>how</i>-to-do-it develops. </p><p> Every day all over the nation young people start working in new jobs. Each of them "wishes" that someday he could enjoy the success that goes with reaching the top. But the majority of these young people simply don't have the belief that it takes to reach the top rungs. And they don't reach the top. Believing it's impossible to climb high, they do not discover the steps that lead to great heights. Their behavior remains that of the "average" person. </p><p> But a small number of these young people really believe they will succeed. They approach their work with the "I'm-going-to-the-top" attitude. And with substantial belief they reach the top. Believing they will succeed -- and that it's not impossible -- these folks study and observe the behavior of senior executives. They learn how successful people approach problems and make decisions. They observe the attitudes of successful people. </p><p> The how-to-do-it always comes to the person who believes he can do it. </p><p> A young woman I'm acquainted with decided two years ago that she was going to establish a sales agency to sell mobile homes. She was advised by many that she shouldn't -- and couldn't do it. </p><p> She had less than $3,000 in savings, and was advised the minimum capital investment required was many times that. </p><p> "Look how competitive it is," she was advised. "And besides, what practical experience have you had in selling mobile homes, let alone managing a business?" her advisors asked. </p><p> But this young lady had belief in herself and her ability to succeed. She quickly admitted she lacked capital, that the business was very competitive, and that she lacked experience. </p><p> "But," she said, "all the evidence I can gather shows that the mobile home industry is going to expand. On top of that, I've studied my competition. I know I can do a better job of merchandising trailers than anybody else in this town. I expect to make some mistakes, but I'm going to be on top in a hurry." </p><p> And she was. She had little trouble getting capital. Her absolutely unquestioned belief that she could succeed with this business won her the confidence of two investors. And armed with complete belief, she did the "impossible" -- she got a trailer manufacturer to advance her a limited inventory with no money down. </p><p> Last year she sold over $1,000,000 worth of trailers. </p><p> "Next year," she says, "I expect to gross over $2,000,000." </p><p> Belief, <i>strong belief,</i> triggers the mind to figuring ways and means and how-to. And believing you can succeed makes others place confidence in you. </p><p> Most people do not put much stock in belief. But some, the residents of Successfulville, USA, do! Just a few weeks ago a friend who is an official with a state highway department in a Midwestern state related a "mountain-moving" experience to me. </p><p> "Last month," my friend began, "our department sent notices to a number of engineering companies that we were authorized to retain some firm to design eight bridges as part of our highway building program. The bridges were to be built at a cost of $5,000,000. The engineering firm selected would get a 4 per cent commission, or $200,000, for its design work. </p><p> "I talked with 21 engineering firms about this. The four largest decided right away to submit proposals. The other 17 companies were small, having only 3 to 7 engineers each. The size of the project scared off 16 of these 17. They went over the project, shook their heads, and said in effect, 'It's too big for us. I wish I thought we could handle it, but it's no use even trying.' </p><p> "But one of these small firms, a company with only three engineers, studied the plans and said, 'We can do it. We'll submit a proposal.' They did, and they got the job." </p><p> Those who believe they can move mountains, do. Those who believe they can't, cannot. Belief triggers the power to do. </p><p> Actually, in these modem times belief is doing much bigger things than moving mountains. The most essential element -- in fact, <i>the</i> essential element -- in our space explorations today is belief that space can be mastered. Without firm, unwavering belief that man <i>can</i> travel in space, our scientists would not have the courage, interest, and enthusiasm to proceed. Belief that cancer can be cured will ultimately produce cures for cancer. Currently; there is some talk of building a tunnel under the English Channel to connect England with the Continent. Whether this tunnel is ever built depends on whether responsible people believe it can be built. </p><p> Belief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great books, plays, scientific discoveries. Belief in success is behind every successful business, church, and political organization. Belief in success is the one basic, absolutely essential ingredient in successful people. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can succeed and you will. </p><p> Over the years I've talked with many people who have failed in business ventures and in various careers. I've heard a lot of reasons and excuses for failure. Something especially significant unfolds as conversations with failures develop. In a casual sort of way the failure drops a remark like "To tell the truth, I didn't think it would work" or "I had my misgivings before I even started out" or "Actually, I wasn't too surprised that it didn't work out." </p><p> The "Okay-I'll-give-it-a-try-but-I-don't-think-it-will-work" attitude produces failures. </p><p> Disbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts "reasons" to support the disbelief. Doubt, disbelief, the <i>subconscious will to fail,</i> the <i>not really wanting</i> to succeed, is responsible for most failures. </p><p> Think doubt and fail. </p><p> Think victory and succeed. </p><p> A young fiction writer talked with me recently about her writing ambitions. The name of one of the top writers in her field came up. </p><p> "Oh," she said, "Mr. X is a wonderful writer, but of course, I can't be nearly as successful as he is." </p><p> Her attitude disappointed me very much because I know the writer mentioned. He is not super-intelligent nor super-perceptive, nor super-anything else except super-confident. He believes he is among the best and so he acts and performs the best. </p><p> It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don't worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers. </p><p> Look at it this way. Belief is the thermostat that regulates what we accomplish in life. Study the fellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little. He believes he can't do big things, and he doesn't. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he does has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way the fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller and smaller in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows smaller in the estimation of the people around him. </p><p> Now look across the way at the person who is advancing forward. He believes he is worth much, and he receives much. He believes he can handle big, difficult assignments -- and he does. Everything he does, the way he handles himself with people, his character, his thoughts, his viewpoints, all say, "Here is a professional. He is an important person." </p><p> A person is a product of his own thoughts. Believe Big. Adjust your thermostat forward. Launch your success offensive with honest, sincere belief that you can succeed. Believe big and grow big. </p><p> Several years ago after addressing a group of business men in Detroit, I talked with one of the gentlemen who approached me, introduced himself, and said, "I really enjoyed your talk. Can you spare a few minutes? I'd like very much to discuss a personal experience with you." </p><p> In a few minutes we were comfortably seated in a coffee shop, waiting for some refreshments. </p><p> "I have a personal experience," he began, "that ties in perfectly with what you said this evening about making your mind work for you instead of letting it work against you. I've never explained to anyone how I lifted myself out of the world of mediocrity; but I'd like to tell you about it." </p><p> "And I'd like to hear it," I said. </p><p> "Well, just five years ago I was plodding along, just another guy working in the tool-and-die trade. I made a decent living by average standards. But it was far from ideal. Our home was much too small and there was no money for those many things we wanted. My wife, bless her, didn't complain much, but it was written all over her that she was more resigned to her fate than she was happy. Inside I grew more and more dissatisfied. When I let myself see how I was failing my good wife and two children, I really hurt inside. </p><p> "But today things are really different," my friend continued. "Today we have a beautiful new home on a two-acre lot and a year-round cabin a couple hundred miles north of here. There's no more worry about whether we can send the kids to a good college and my wife no longer has to feel guilty every time she spends money for some new clothes. Next summer the whole family is flying to Europe to spend a month's holiday. We're really living." </p><p> "How did this all happen?" I asked. </p><p> "It all happened," he continued, "when to use the phrase you used tonight, 'I harnessed the power of belief.' Five years ago I learned about a job with a tool-and-die company here in Detroit. We were living in Cleveland at the time. I decided to look into it, hoping I could make a little more money. I got here early on Sunday evening, but the interview was not until Monday. </p><p> "After dinner I sat down in my hotel room and for some reason, I got really disgusted with myself. 'Why,' I asked myself, 'am I just a middle class failure? Why am I trying to get a job that represents such a small step forward?' </p><p> "I don't know to this day what prompted me to do it, but I took a sheet of hotel stationery and wrote down the names of five people I've known well for several years who had far surpassed me in earning power and job responsibility. Two were former neighbors who had moved away to fine subdivisions. Two others were fellows I had worked for, and the third was a brother-in-law. </p><p> "Next -- again I don't know what made me do this -- I asked myself what do my five friends have that I don't have, besides better jobs. I compared myself with them on intelligence, but I honestly couldn't see that they excelled in the brains department. Nor could I truthfully say they had me beat on education, integrity; or personal habits. </p><p> "Finally I got down to another success quality one hears a lot about. Initiative. Here I hated to admit it, but I had to. On this point my record showed I was far below that of my successful friends. </p><p> "It was now about 3:00 A.M., but my mind was astonishingly clear. I was seeing my weak point for the first time. I discovered that I had held back. I had always carried a little stick. I dug into myself deeper and deeper and found the reason I lacked initiative was because I didn't believe inside that I was worth very much. </p><p> "I sat there the rest of the night just reviewing how lack of faith in myself had dominated me ever since I could remember, how I had used my mind to work against myself. I found I had been preaching to myself why I couldn't get ahead instead of why I could. I had been selling myself short. I found this streak of self-depreciation showed through in everything I did. Then it dawned on me that no one else was going to believe in me until I believed in myself. </p><p> "Right then I decided, 'I'm through feeling second-class. From here on in I'm not going to sell myself short.' </p><p> "Next morning I still had that confidence. During the job interview I gave my new found confidence its first test. Before coming for the interview I'd hoped I would have courage to ask for $750 or maybe even $1000 more than my present job was paying. But now, after realizing I <i>was</i> a valuable man, I upped it to $3,500. And I got it. I sold myself because after that one long night of self-analysis I found things in myself that made me a lot more saleable. </p><p> "Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as the fellow who can get business. Then we went into a recession. This made me still more valuable because I was one of the best business-getters in the industry. The company was reorganized and I was given a substantial amount of stock plus a lot more pay." </p><p> Believe in yourself and good things <i>do</i> start happening. </p><p> Your mind is a "thought factory." It's a busy factory; producing countless thoughts in one day. </p><p> Production in your thought factory is under the charge of two foremen, one of whom we will call Mr. Triumph and the other Mr. Defeat. Mr. Triumph is in charge of manufacturing positive thoughts. He specializes in producing reasons why you can, why you're qualified, why you will. </p><p> The other foreman, Mr. Defeat, produces negative, depreciating tho...</p></p><h2>Forest of Enchantment Tarot</h2><p>Once you step into the enchanted wood, your life&#x2015;and your spirit&#x2015;will never be the same.

Children will especially love reading and rereading this book to laugh about the exceptions to the 10 birthday rules and to point out fun details of Lichtenheld's anthropomorphic animal drawings. Every birthday rule has at least one exception, and each one is silly, charming, or both. For example, food, streamers, confetti, and balloons are great for a party unless you are an animal that is "pointy in any way." If so, author Ferry observes that these animals might want to "skip the balloons," and Lichtenheld's illustrations of a rhino, swordfish, and sea urchin all popping balloons are wonderful, as are their short apologetic commentaries ("oopsie," "sorry," "my bad"). Along with the rules and the humorous exceptions, the story has a pervading sweetness, reminding grown-ups to cherish the days of birthday wishes and to celebrate the optimism and hopefulness of young children.

Peter Barton was that kind of person.</p><p>Driven by the ideals that sparked a generation, he became an overachieving Everyman, a risk-taker who showed others what was possible. Then, in the prime of his life&#x2014;hugely successful, happily married, and the father of three children&#x2014;Peter faced the greatest of all challenges. Diagnosed with cancer, he began a journey that was not only frightening and appalling but also full of wonder and discovery.</p><p>With unflinching candor and even surprising humor, Not Fade Away finds meaning and solace in Peter's confrontation with mortality.

Peter Barton was that kind of person. </p><p> He protested at Columbia University in the 1960s, played soul music at Harlem's Apollo Theater, spent time as a ski bum and a craps dealer, and eventually emerged from Harvard Business School to become a central figure in the creation of cable television. In the prime of his life, happily married and the father of three young children, Peter came face to face with the biggest challenge in a life filled with risk-taking and direction-changing. Diagnosed with cancer, he began a journey both frightening and appalling, yet also full of wonder and discovery. </p><p> <i>Not Fade Away</i> recreates that journey in the intimate and alternating voices of Peter and of Laurence Shames--two men close in age yet who've chosen vastly different lives. Together, in a spirit of deepening friendship, they relive the high points of years that embodied the hopes and strivings of an entire generation. With courage, candor, and even humor, they search for meaning in Peter's unflinching confrontation with mortality. </p><p> In life, Peter was an overachieving Everyman, a vibrant spirit who showed his peers just how much is possible. In his dying, similarly, he redefines the quietly heroic tasks of seeking clarity in the midst of pain and loss; of breaking through to a highly personal, secular faith; and of achieving peace at last. </p><p> "Peter Barton and Laurence Shames, the graceful writer he persuaded to help him tell this tale, have produced a worthy monument, a book about how to live, and how to die." </p><p> --Ken Auletta </p><p> Peter Barton was a founder and CEO of Liberty Media and a passionate advocate for such innovative programming as the Discovery Channel, Fox Sports Net, Black Entertainment Television, and QVC.

Not only does this observance remind us of our rescue from Egyptian bondage, but, we remember Messiah&#39;s last supper, a Passover seder. The theme of redemption is seen throughout the evening. What&#39;s so unique about our Haggadah is the focus on Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah and his teaching, especially on his last night in the upper room. Now, we&#39;ve included words and sheet music of the songs mentioned in the book and sung on Passover. Singing them will enrich your experience. Also, we&#39;ve used the popular Complete Jewish Bible for translations where Scripture is quoted.</p><p>Preparing for Passover <p>"For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses. . ." Exodus 12:15 </p><p>During the days before Passover, leavened items are removed from the home. These include all breads and cakes that contain yeast. Preparation begins with a thorough cleaning, culminating in a ceremonial search for leaven, called bedikat khameytz. </p><p>Let us also ready our hearts for the Passover seder, the order of service. Tradition teaches that in each generation, we must consider ourselves as having personally been freed from Egypt. As we prepare for this experience of personal redemption, let us put far from us the leaven of sin hidden within our hearts. </p><p>Haggadah means "the telling." Passover is a story that has been retold for thousands of years. It is a story of miraculous transitions &#x2014; from slavery to freedom, from despair to hope, from darkness to light. Its greatness is the greatness of God. Its timelessness comes from the eternal truth of His involvement with His people. As God cared for the children of Israel in ancient times, He cares for all who are His today. </p><p>Upon the table is a seder plate, holding the ceremonial items of Passover. There are bitter herbs, a roasted egg, a sweet apple mixture, parsley, and a bone. Curious things, yet all part of the telling. Let us allow our senses to fully participate, taking in the sights and smells, tasting each ingredient, listening to every word. Let us see, hear, and feel the truth of God&#x2019;s love. </p><p>One of Messiah&#x2019;s last earthly acts was the celebration of the Passover. Gathering his disciples in a small room in Jerusalem, he led them in a seder. "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer." (Luke 22:15) He passed the foods among them. It was there, in the context of this celebration that Yeshua revealed to them the mystery of God&#x2019;s plan of redemption. He spoke to them of his body and blood. He explained to them that he would have to die. </p><p>It was no coincidence that Messiah chose the Passover for the setting of what is now celebrated as communion, the Lord&#x2019;s supper. For in the story of the Passover lamb, Yeshua could best communicate the course he would be taking over the confusing hours that were to follow. Here, as we participate together in the Passover seder, may we experience once again God&#x2019;s great redemption.</p></p><h2>Draw 50 Cats: The Step-by-Step Way to Draw Domestic Breeds, Wild Cats, Cuddly Kittens, and Famous Felines</h2><p>This book brings to life Siamese, Persians, lions, tigers, panthers and such celebrity felines as Felix, Top Cat and Snaggle Puss.</p><p>Lee Judah Ames (January 8, 1921 &#x2013; June 3, 2011 ) was an American artist noted for his Draw 50... learn-to-draw books.

Being a mysterious figure yourself, has this ever happened to you? </p> <p> <strong>Pittacus:</strong> I have always taken great care to conceal my identity. I change my appearance regularly. I do not speak or correspond with many people. No one has ever suspected me of being what I am, which is an alien military leader with superpowers. If anyone ever does, it will be a bad day for me. </p> <p> <strong>Will:</strong> Why is now the time to write the unknown history of the planet Lorien and the Nine? What do you think the people of Earth can learn from the Lorien Legacies? </p> <p> <strong>Pittacus:</strong> We are in the middle of a war to save the remaining Lorien, and to save earth. We thought the people of earth might want to know about it. I hope humanity does not make the same mistake we did on our planet, which was to be unprepared the day war arrived on a grand scale. </p> <p> <strong>Will:</strong> Who do you think would win in a fight, Dracula or a Mogadorian? </p> <p> <strong>Pittacus:</strong> Dracula wouldn&#x2019;t stand a chance. If he tried to drink Mogadorian blood he&#x2019;d poison himself. It&#x2019;s would be like drinking battery acid. </p> <p> <strong>Will:</strong> Number Four has his legacies as his best weapon. Do you think John could be an agent of <em>Department Nineteen</em>? </p> <p> <strong>Pittacus:</strong> Once we have vanquished the Mogadorians, maybe that is what he will become. He certainly has some mad skills. </p> <p> <strong>Will:</strong> Sarah in <em>I Am Number Four</em> is in love with an alien. Jamie in <em>Department Nineteen</em> is falling for a vampire named Larissa. What makes young love just so difficult?

By December 25, 2011, at the age of fifteen, he became the youngest person to climb to the summit of the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. He is now touring the United States, climbing the tallest peak in each of the fifty states. He lives in Big Bear Lake, California.No Summit out of Sight CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>It was the first day of fourth grade when I told my dad I had decided to climb the highest peak on each of the seven continents: the Seven Summits.<br> <br>I was nine, and all summer long I&#x2019;d been thinking about a mural on the wall of my elementary school, which laid out each of the Seven Summits and their elevations. I&#x2019;d passed it every day on my way to and from recess, all through third grade. Other kids hardly seemed to notice it in their rush to play soccer or basketball, but I often stopped and stared, mesmerized by those mountains. What would it be like to stand on their summits and gaze across entire continents? I wanted to find out.<br> <br>One thing you should know about me: When I get interested in something, I become a fanatic and learn everything I can about it. When I was younger and got interested in reptiles, I learned everything there was to know about every species. Now my interest turned to mountains.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve always jumped into new interests with both feet, especially if they have to do with the outdoors. I&#x2019;ve never been into playing video games or watching TV. Practically from the moment I could walk, I was outdoors&#x2014;chasing lizards, riding my bike, skateboarding, and skiing. Especially skiing. That was my passion.<br> <br>But I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about those mountains. Over the summer between third and fourth grades, I did Internet searches to read about the summits. I made lists of their locations, their elevations, and the best routes to the top of each. Along the way I discovered that there were people who had made it a goal to climb all seven.<br> <br>I decided I could do that.<br> <br>I was the ultimate goal setter, so at that age I already understood that things didn&#x2019;t always happen instantly.<br> <br>But that was okay. I was also extremely patient.<br> <br>And frankly, I didn&#x2019;t think the idea would shock my dad that much. My dad and my stepmom, Karen, are professional athletes. They compete in extreme adventure races all over the world. It&#x2019;s a crazy sport. They race nonstop on foot, on bicycles, in kayaks and canoes, and even on horses and camels. And they do it all in some of the most wild and remote places in the world. Our home has always been open to a never-ending stream of competitive athletes who are driven to enter the most brutal contests on the planet.<br> <br>Dad and Karen thought outside the box, set huge goals, and grabbed life with both hands. So why couldn&#x2019;t I?<br> <br>Seeing that mural again on the first day of fourth grade help sharpen my resolve. My dad picked me up from school that day, and I sprang it on him.<br> <br>He was going on and on about this killer endurance event he and Karen were training for. They&#x2019;d been preparing nonstop for weeks. They were always going, going, going. They believed you should live your life, not watch it. Their motto hung on the front of the house: GO FAST. TAKE CHANCES.<br> <br>And I intended to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Dad, you ever heard of the Seven Summits?&#x201d;<br> <br>He glanced at me. &#x201c;Sort of, Little J,&#x201d; he said, using his nickname for me.<br> <br>I paused, took a deep breath, and exhaled slowly. &#x201c;I want to climb them.&#x201d;<br> <br>His jaw dropped, and he stared at me openmouthed for a minute.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oookaaay,&#x201d; he said. My dad has this way of stretching an &#x201c;okay&#x201d; out for a mile. This one went for two miles.<br> <br>I could tell he thought this was a someday kind of goal. But I wanted to do it sooner. &#x201c;Not when I&#x2019;m older, but, like, right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>That really surprised him.<br> <br>&#x201c;What made you decide that?&#x201d;<br> <br>I told him about the mural, and about how I had been looking at it for years and thinking about what it would be like to stand on top of each of those mountains and look at the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really know about all this?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>That was it, bang. I told him about all the stuff I&#x2019;d learned&#x2014;where and how high each summit was, what countries they were in, the best routes to the top of each summit.<br> <br>My dad has a huge smile, one that can light up a whole room. And nothing makes him happier than the idea of an athletic challenge. I watched his face closely, waiting for that smile. I guess I half expected him to say, Okay. Let&#x2019;s buy tickets for every corner of the world and leave tomorrow.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mountaineering is long, hard, and dirty,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not all fun. You&#x2019;d need weeks and even months of training before you could even think of climbing even the smallest ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care. I can do it,&#x201d; I answered.<br> <br>Dad thought about it for a minute. He didn&#x2019;t say yes, but he didn&#x2019;t exactly say no, either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get Super K,&#x201d; he said, using his nickname for Karen, &#x201c;and go for a hike.&#x201d;</p><h2>Kane Chronicles, The Book Three: Serpent&#39;s Shadow, The-Kane Chronicles, The Book Three</h2><p>If you haven't yet read the Kane Chronicles, Rick Riordan's action-adventure trilogy based on Ancient Egyptian mythology, don't miss this paperback edition with new cover art and a Percy Jackson-Kane Chronicles crossover story, "The Crown of Ptolemy." When young magicians Carter and Sadie Kane learned how to follow the path of the Ancient Egyptian gods, they knew they would have to play an important role in restoring Ma'at--order--to the world. What they didn't know is how chaotic the world would become. The Chaos snake Apophis is loose and threatening to destroy the earth in three days' time. The magicians are divided. The gods are disappearing, and those who remain are weak. Walt, one of Carter and Sadie's most gifted initiates, is doomed and can already feel his life force ebbing. Zia is too busy babysitting the senile sun god, Ra, to be of much help. What are a couple of teenagers and a handful of young trainees to do? There is possibly one way to stop Apophis, but it is so difficult that it might cost Carter and Sadie their lives, if it even works at all. It involves trusting the ghost of a psychopathic magician not to betray them, or worse, kill them. They'd have to be crazy to try it. Well, call them crazy. With hilarious asides, memorable monsters, and an ever-changing crew of friends and foes, the excitement never lets up in <i>The Serpent's Shadow</i>, a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the Kane Chronicles.</p><p><strong>Rick Riordan</strong>, dubbed "storyteller of the gods" by <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, is the author of five #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-selling middle grade series with millions of copies sold throughout the world: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, The Heroes of Olympus, and the Trials of Apollo, based on Greek and Roman mythology; the Kane Chronicles, based on Ancient Egyptian mythology; and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard, based on Norse mythology.

We&#x2019;re planning our next sleepover. Sam&#x2019;s parents have the tent and sleeping bags; her mom even bought us cool spy pen-flashlights just for the occasion. To top it off, it&#x2019;s Friday and summer&#x2019;s only two weeks away.<br><br>Jack, my teacher, passes out recipes from the next and last country our fifth-grade class will be studying--India. I look down and see the makings of biryani, which is a special kind of rice dish. Jack always teaches us about the country&#x2019;s food first, then gives us the lay of the land and the history. Getting to know the food, Jack says, is the best way to really understand a country, just like sharing a meal with someone helps you get to know them. You can tell a lot from what a person eats. I agree. Jack always brings huge, delicious, sloppy sandwiches for his lunch, like meatball subs and Philly cheesesteaks, and that&#x2019;s sort of how he is--a big, friendly, messy man.<br><br>Jack takes everyone into the school kitchen and we&#x2019;re all assigned jobs. I have to measure the rice. Sam has to measure the spices. Other kids shell peas. Jack does all the chopping with the sharp knives. Before you know it, the rice is cooking and people are helping Jack saut� the onions, garlic, and spices. He tells everybody to stand back and holds the pan up, tossing all the ingredients like some super-famous chef, except Jack isn&#x2019;t a super-famous chef and half of it lands on the floor. The delicious smells swirl around my nose and make my stomach growl. I love biryani. Life&#x2019;s pretty good.<br><br>Then I get home. Mom&#x2019;s face is all droopy--the way it looks when she&#x2019;s upset. But she doesn&#x2019;t say much. She just stirs and stirs something in a pot on the stove. I look in and see a mess of purple mush. Eggplant skins and empty tofu packages sit on the counter. Tofu makes my eyes hurt. It makes my head hurt. It makes my throat hurt. My younger sister, Natasha, appears on the stairs with her drumsticks. She starts drumming on the railing and Mom tells her to practice in her room. I go off to get my homework over with. I have an essay to write on what it&#x2019;s like to live in India, but I don&#x2019;t need to do any research. I just have to ask my dad. He was born there.<br><br>Finally, at dinner, while I&#x2019;m trying to figure out why the tofu is so purple, Mom says, &#x201c;Kids--&#x201d;<br><br>And Dad says, &#x201c;Wait, I&#x2019;ll--&#x201d;<br><br>And Mom says, &#x201c;You should--&#x201d;<br><br>And Natasha says, &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; because she&#x2019;s five years younger than I am and doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with herself half the time.<br><br>And Dad says, &#x201c;I have some bad news,&#x201d; which explains why Mom&#x2019;s acting strange and probably why the tofu&#x2019;s so purple. His face looks red and a little puffy, like he&#x2019;s going to cry. I&#x2019;ve actually never seen my father cry. Two years ago my uncle died, Dad&#x2019;s brother, and Dad didn&#x2019;t cry at the funeral. Not that he wasn&#x2019;t sad, because he looked sadder than I&#x2019;ve ever seen him.<br><br>&#x201c;I lost my job. I was fired,&#x201d; he says. His eyes are wide.<br><br>Dad is, or was, head of sales for a company that publishes math and science textbooks. Sometimes he brings the books home. They&#x2019;re really heavy, with very thin pages, and are meant for college kids. They have crazy titles like Funda�mentals of Human Biology and An Introduction to Differential Geometry. It makes me dizzy just looking at the covers, which are always filled with graphs, numbers, and outlines or silhouettes of someone&#x2019;s big smart head. Dad can understand them, though. He used to be a math professor at the same college where Mom teaches English literature. That&#x2019;s where they fell in love.<br><br>The reason he was fired, Dad explains, is because he had a bad quarter.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a quarter?&#x201d; I ask. He looks at me and tries to smile, but the corners of his mouth don&#x2019;t quite make it. He takes a deep breath and rubs his chin.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a period of three months, a quarter of a year. Sales were down last quarter. Way down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>A lot more questions zip through my head. Like why were the last three months so bad? Did he make someone really mad? Will he get another job? My heart speeds up, but I keep quiet. Natasha presses her fork into her purple tofu casserole, mashes it flat with the prongs.<br><br>&#x201c;Who wants dessert?&#x201d; Mom asks, even though we&#x2019;ve all barely touched our dinner. She usually makes sure we&#x2019;ve eaten enough of every weird thing she puts on the table, but I guess Mom doesn&#x2019;t really want to eat her tofu casserole any more than we do. I get up and help her clean off the table. She takes mint chocolate chip frozen yogurt out of the freezer and starts to heap it in big white bowls lined up on the counter. I take a bite of mine, and for a moment, the cool minty sweetness is all I can think about.</p><h2>My Hero Academia, Vol. 19 (19)</h2><p>Midoriya inherits the superpower of the world&#x2019;s greatest hero, but greatness won&#x2019;t come easy.<br><br>What would the world be like if 80 percent of the population manifested superpowers called &#x201c;Quirks&#x201d;?

My Hero</p><h2>The Last Juror: A Novel</h2><p><p>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<br><br>In 1970, Willie Traynor comes to Clanton, Mississippi, in a Triumph Spitfire and a fog of vague ambitions. Within a year, the twenty-three-year-old finds himself the owner of Ford County&#x2019;s only newspaper, famous for its well-crafted obituaries. While the rest of America is in the grips of turmoil, Clanton lives on the edge of another age&#x2014;until the brutal murder of a young mother rocks the town and thrusts Willie into the center of a storm.<br><br>Daring to report the true horrors of the crime, Willie makes as many friends as enemies in Clanton, and over the next decade he sometimes wonders how he got there in the first place. But he can never escape the crime that shattered his innocence or the criminal whose evil left an indelible stain. Because as the ghosts of the South&#x2019;s past gather around Willie, as tension swirls around Clanton, men and women who served on a jury nine years ago are starting to die one by one&#x2014;as a killer exacts the ultimate revenge.</p></p><p>In 1970, small town newspaper <i>The Clanton Times</i> went belly up. With financial assistance from a rich relative, it's purchased by 23-year-old Willie Traynor, formerly the paper's cub reporter. Soon afterward, his new business receives the readership boost it needs thanks to his editorial efforts and coverage of a particularly brutal rape and murder committed by the scion of the town's reclusive bootlegger family. Rather than shy from reporting on the subsequent open-and-shut trial (those who oppose the Padgitt family tend to turn up dead in the area's swampland), Traynor launches a crusade to ensure the unrepentant murderer is brought to justice. When a guilty verdict is returned, the town is relieved to find the Padgitt family's grip on the town did not sway the jury, though Danny Padgitt is sentenced to life in prison rather than death. But, when Padgitt is released after serving less than a decade in jail and members of the jury are murdered, Clanton once again finds itself at the mercy of its renegade family.<p> When it comes, the d�nouement is no surprise; <i>The Last Juror</i> is less a story of suspense than a study of the often idyllic southern town of Clanton, Mississippi (the setting for Grisham's first novel, <i>A Time to Kill</i>). Throughout the nine years between Padgitt's trial and release, Traynor finds acceptance in Clanton, where the people "don't really trust you unless they trusted your grandfather." He grows from a long-haired idealist into another of the town's colorful characters--renovating an old house, sporting a bowtie, beloved on both sides of the color line, and the only person to have attended each of the town's 88 churches at least once. <i>The Last Juror</i> returns Grisham to the courtroom where he made his name, but those who enjoyed the warm sentiment of his recent novels (<i>Bleachers</i>, <i>A Painted House</i>) will still find much to love here. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>In 1970, one of Mississippi's more colorful weekly newspapers, "The Ford County Times, went bankrupt. To the surprise and dismay of many, ownership was assumed by a 23 year-old college dropout, named Willie Traynor. The future of the paper looked grim until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. Willie Traynor reported all the gruesome details, and his newspaper began to prosper. <br>The murderer, Danny Padgitt, was tried before a packed courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi. The trial came to a startling and dramatic end when the defendant threatened revenge against the jurors if they convicted him. Nevertheless, they found him guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison. <br>But in Mississippi in 1970, "life" didn't necessarily mean "life," and nine years later Danny Padgitt managed to get himself paroled. He returned to Ford County, and the retribution began. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Locke &amp; Key Master Edition Volume 1</h2><p><ul> <li>Named a "modern masterpiece" by The A.V.

This must-have book draws from the most current research and provides multiple practical examples, protocols, and essential questions to guide us in making collaborative practices a reality in our own particular settings."</em> -- Dr. Debbie Zacarian, President Published On: 2017-06-28<br><br><em>"Dr. Dove and Dr. Honigsfeld articulated it very clearly when they presented to our teachers of ELLS in Western New York: &#x2032;You cannot have successful co-teaching without co-planning.&#x2032; Their new books continues the much-needed conversation on how to co-teach by looking carefully at the relationships and the school-based opportunities required for success. All teachers have the need to refine new practices in our profession that lead our students effective academic outcomes. Dove and Honigsfeld have a unique ability to define with ease the why and the how of tackling effective co-teaching for ELLs. We must change the ways we have always done our work as teachers. There is no going back when we know more because of the work of these two important researchers."</em> -- Denise Gonez-Santos, Executive Director Published On: 2017-07-11<br><br><em>"Dove and Honigsfeld have captured the essence of co-teaching through the recommended practice of collaborative teamwork using Model 7: Multiple Groups Two Model/ Teach.&nbsp; One example of this model demonstrated how both teachers are engaged in small group instruction and plan for independent activities where students explore grade level content with the scaffolding of and modifications to age appropriate readings. To ensure success when using this co-teaching model, the research shared by the authors demonstrated the necessity of students to be involved in highly engaging activities while discovering new information. This hands-on learning approach allows English learners to develop new language skills through the application of speaking, reading, and writing tasks."</em> -- Susan Brown, English Learner Specialist Published On: 2017-07-11<br><br><p><em>"As a large and diverse urban school system, our district needed to create a service model structure to meet the needs of over 15,000 English Learner students (ELs), representing over 120 languages. We selected co-teaching as one of the service models because this model allowed students to remain in the content class with their native English-speaking peers while receiving their required EL services. Co-teaching is an ideal model for our district because it allows for students at all levels of English language proficiency access to the complex grade-level content, tasks, and standards while acquiring productive and receptive language skills. With the support of Dr. Dove and Dr. Honigsfeld, our district is in our second year of implementing the EL co-teaching model. We started by analyzing the data and grouping students based on their language needs and allowing the EL teacher to co-teach in sheltered ELD/English Language Arts classes. In this classes, we saw over 2 years growth as evidenced by text level assessments. At the middle and high school level, co-teaching expanded to content classes to support English learners through an integrated approach alongside the content teacher. Both models proved to be successful for our district as we added another 29 EL co-teachers this school year. Dr. Dove and Dr. Honigsfeld&#x2032;s new book provides a deep dive into the advantages and challenges of each co-teaching model along with low-prep strategies for the partners. This is essential in helping the content and EL teacher select the appropriate model for their setting and to implement high-yield strategies in the integrated language and content setting. The authors highlight the importance of collaboration among EL teachers and content teachers to have shared accountability for the academic, linguistic and social emotional success of ELs."</em></p> -- Molly Stovall Hegwood, Director of EL Services Published On: 2017-07-11<br><br><p><em>"This important follow-up volume is just what we need, just in time!&nbsp;It will invigorate co-teachers of English Learners while urging them to refocus their attention from &#x2032;just co-teaching&#x2032; to the truly effectual work of teacher collaboration throughout the entire instructional cycle.&nbsp; At the same time, best practices for student engagement and focused English language development are clearly described within a deep analysis of the seven co-teaching models.

And what better way to do that than by collaborating and co-teaching with intentionality and precision? Offering structures and strategies for each of 7 key models of co-planning and co-teaching, the authors have given us all we need to meet our common goals in a compelling, detailed, and inescapably helpful resource.

It is with respect of educators of the field that the authors have truly demystified how successful partnerships unfold honoring the power of the whole collaborative planning cycle. By providing in depth illustrations and real life scenarios with several variations to highlight a variety of contexts, this book allows for multiple entry points. Honestly, in all my roles in education over the last 22 years, including ESL/ELD teacher, classroom teacher, resource teacher and even now as a leader supporting over 250 schools to address the needs of ELs, I have never found a resource that does what Dove and Honigsfeld have achieved here. &nbsp;This book is ideal for school teams, teachers with their administrators, ready to roll their sleeves up. I have always believed that supporting linguistically diverse students to achieve academic should not be beyond our reach and would wonder why many districts share the experience that they cannot get there effectively. Dove and Honigsfeld have revealed where the link has been broken.&nbsp; Their research is focused on intentionally orchestrating conditions in classrooms for students to learn the content while acquiring the language of instruction this to happen in tandem.

She received a degree in secondary education from Western Michigan University. She has traveled extensively and enjoys time with her family.&nbsp; <em>Hero Dad</em> is her first book and is about being the child of a military father, from the child's point of view.</p> <p><strong> </strong> Illustrator Bryan Langdo lives in New Jersey. He has illustrated nearly thirty books for children, and wrote two of them. <br></p>K-Gr 2&#x2013;This sunny picture book opens with the stirring words, &#x201c;My dad is a superhero.&#x201d; However, readers soon discover that he is not a caped crusader: he is a United States soldier in fatigues. As the proud boy explains, Dad has real-life corollaries to the traditional superhero accessories, for example, a rifle instead of a laser gun. The illustrations often flesh out the child's vision. The words on one spread, &#x201c;He can't fly&#x2013;well, sometimes he can,&#x201d; are accompanied by a picture of Dad and his buddies parachuting from a plane. The bright, cartoon artwork makes the book child-friendly and evokes superhero comic books. Meanwhile, the luminous watercolors make the difficult subject matter approachable for young children faced with separation from military parents. Hardin's first-person narrative helps them voice their own feelings, and reassuringly, this dad comes home. For most collections, especially those serving military communities.<i>Mary Landrum, Lexington Public Library, KY</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

He was a vagrant hippie who wandered to Toronto, where he ended up playing with Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, and he became a household name in the 1980s with his hit song &#x201c;Super Freak.&#x201d; Later in life, he was a bad boy who got caught up in drug smuggling and ended up in prison. But since his passing in August 2004, Rick James has remained a legendary icon whose name is nearly synonymous with funk music&#x2014;and who popularized the genre, creating a lasting influence on pop artists from Prince to Jay-Z to Snoop Dogg, among countless others.<br> <br>In <i>Glow</i>, Rick James and acclaimed music biographer David Ritz collaborated to write a no-holds-barred memoir about the boy and the man who became a music superstar in America&#x2019;s disco age. It tells of James&#x2019;s upbringing and how his mother introduced him to musical geniuses of the time. And it reveals details on many universally revered artists, from Marvin Gaye and Prince to Nash, Teena Marie, and Berry Gordy. James himself said, &#x201c;My journey has taken me through hell and back. It&#x2019;s all in my music&#x2014;the parties, the pain, the oversized ego, the insane obsessions.&#x201d; But despite his bad boy behavior, James was a tremendous talent and a unique, unforgettable human being. His &#x201c;glow&#x201d; was an overriding quality that one of his mentors saw in him&#x2014;and one that will stay with this legendary figure who left an indelible mark on American popular music.</p><p>Rick James was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer, best known for popularizing funk music in the late 1970s and early 1980s thanks to million-selling hits.<br><br>David Ritz is a songwriter who has collaborated with stars like Janet Jackson and Marvin Gaye, as well as a renowned ghostwriter who has authored more than fifty books for some of the biggest stars in music: Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Lenny Kravitz, Joe Perry, Smokey Robinson, Don Rickles, and Willie Nelson, to name a few.

The dreams are so vivid&#x2014;so wildly creative&#x2014;that I know God is in charge of my imagination. I couldn&#x2019;t dream up this shit without God. God has to be the author of my dreams. In one dream, I&#x2019;m with Miles Davis. We&#x2019;re dressed like African princes. Our robes are blue and gold. Miles is singing and I&#x2019;m playing trumpet. Black angels are surrounding us. We&#x2019;re bathed in sunlight. We&#x2019;re on top of the Empire State Building and everyone in the city of New York can hear us. The people are assembled on the street; they&#x2019;re hanging out their windows and waving flags from office buildings. Helicopters are flying over us, but our music is so powerful that we drown out all noise. Our music is some symphony that has the angels dancing in the sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t know you could play jazz so good,&#x201d; Miles says to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t know you could sing so funky,&#x201d; I say to him.<br> <br>The music is so beautiful I start crying through Miles&#x2019;s horn.<br> <br>Someone says, &#x201c;The hospitals are clearing out. The patients are healed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Someone else says, &#x201c;The churches are clearing. The congregations are in the streets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; says Miles. &#x201c;I told you we could do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>When I put the trumpet to my lips again, the horn turns into a megaphone. When I start to speak, I hear the voice of my mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;My son has the answer,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Miles gave him the answer. Listen to my son.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn to Miles, who rarely smiles, and see that he is smiling.<br> <br>When I wake up from this dream, I am smiling.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m still in jail.<br> <br><br> <br>This long stay in jail is the first time I&#x2019;m remembering my dreams. I&#x2019;m not even sure I had dreams before they put my ass behind bars. My mind was clogged up with cocaine&#x2014;not just any cocaine, but cocaine strong enough to fuel jet engines. I was a jet engine that got dislodged from the plane of my brain. I crashed to the ground and broke into a million pieces. When the pieces magically came back together, the engine could work again. But the fuel was no longer cocaine. The fuel was something I hadn&#x2019;t used since I was a little boy. I&#x2019;d call it natural energy and natural drive. It&#x2019;s a natural restlessness to see and explore and learn. Couldn&#x2019;t do any of that exploring when I was ripping and running through the world of intoxicants. Didn&#x2019;t wanna explore. Just wanted to stay high.<br> <br>So ain&#x2019;t this a bitch? My highs are my dreams. My dreams are my escape. And my imagination is my way out of prison. If you break down the word &#x201c;imagination,&#x201d; I guess it means manufacturing images. Dreaming is the purest form of that process&#x2014;so, for as long as I&#x2019;m locked up, I&#x2019;m gonna write down my dreams.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m also gonna write down my life.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve always wanted to write my own life story. But outside of prison I could never sit down and be quiet. My energy was scattered. I was always going in a dozen different directions at once. But now I got no choice. Got nowhere to go and nothing to do. I&#x2019;m forced to read. And in reading&#x2014;especially about the lives of people I relate to&#x2014;I get excited. I read about Charlie Parker, Nat King Cole, Bob Marley, and Malcolm X, and I understand exactly why their lives went the way they did. I see their fuckups as my fuckups; I see their talents as my talents. Sometimes talent is so big it takes you to places that you don&#x2019;t understand. Super talent doesn&#x2019;t take you to the Land of Peace; it takes you to Crazyland. And if you ain&#x2019;t emotionally grounded in something rock-solid, you gonna get annihilated.<br> <br>I got annihilated. Now I&#x2019;m getting healed. And part of the healing is dreaming, remembering, and writing.<br> <br>I can write in peace because I don&#x2019;t have access to my lethal vices. Being a celebrity in jail also means I have protectors who keep the bad cats away from me. They see I&#x2019;m serious about writing and form a shield around me.<br> <br>In prison, I&#x2019;ve gravitated toward the bookish brothas. I&#x2019;ve met Muslims who have taken me deep into the Koran. I love and respect Islam. I was raised Catholic but never really studied the Bible till late in life. The Christian brothas in prison have given me a new way to look at the Word. A Jewish man has been talking about Kabbalah, mysticism with wisdom of its own.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t worry. I ain&#x2019;t gonna shove no religion down your throat. I&#x2019;m not using this book to win converts. I&#x2019;m just using the book to manufacture images from my past. I just wanna look at old pictures, lay &#x2019;em out there, and, like a jigsaw puzzle, see if I can make the pieces fit. See if I can make sense of a life of nonsense and understand how I got to be caged up like an animal.<br> <br>I am an animal, a fuckin&#x2019; wild animal. I lost my human soul. I lost my human mind. But in this animal cage, my intention is to win back my humanity. Animals can&#x2019;t write.<br> <br>I can.<br> <br>I will.<br> <br>Here goes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><h2>This Earl of Mine: A Bow Street Bachelors Novel (Bow Street Bachelors, 1)</h2><p><p><b>"Bateman's scintillating first Bow Street Bachelors Regency is full of intense emotions and dramatic twists.

Did its forces fight heroically against all odds for the cause of states&#x2019; rights? In reality, these suggestions are an elaborate and intentional effort on the part of Southerners to rationalize the secession and the war itself. Unfortunately, skillful propagandists have been so successful in promoting this romanticized view that the Lost Cause has assumed a life of its own. Misrepresenting the war&#x2019;s true origins and its actual course, the myth of the Lost Cause distorts our national memory. In <i>The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History,</i> nine historians describe and analyze the Lost Cause, identifying ways in which it falsifies history&#x2015;creating a volume that makes a significant contribution to Civil War historiography.</p></p><p><p>Gary W. Gallagher is John L. Nau III Professor of History at the University of Virginia. He has written or edited a number of books in the field of Civil War&#x2013;era history, including, most recently, <i>The Confederate War</i>, <i>Lee and His Generals in War and Memory;</i> and<i> Causes Won, Lost, and Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know about the Civil War.</i></p><p>Alan T. Nolan (1923&#x2013;2008) is author of <i>Lee Considered: Robert E. Lee and Civil War History</i> and <i>The Iron Brigade: A Military History</i> (IUP, 1994), and editor (with Sharon Eggleston Vipond) of <i>Giants in Their Tall Black Hats: Essays on the Iron Brigade</i> (IUP, 1998).</p>The South lost the Civil War, but southerners have certainly held their own in the postwar battle to shape historical interpretations of the conflict. Southern politicians, war veterans, and historians successfully promoted the "Lost Cause" view of the origins and results of our national nightmare. The South, so the story goes, wanted to preserve its unique culture, and slavery was not a fundamental basis of that culture. Led by valiant gentlemen-officers (e.g., Robert E. Lee) and brave, defiant common soldiers, the Confederacy struggled against insurmountable odds, eventually succumbing to numerically but not morally superior forces. This collection of essays by nine Civil War scholars shows how the myth was consciously propagated by southerners, often in an attempt to rationalize the physical and social carnage left by the war. These essays are well reasoned and timely, given current controversies raging over the display of the Confederate battle flag. This will be a valuable addition to Civil War collections. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Working with the invisible energy (Qi) that flows through these pathways, they were able to heal illness. Perhaps more importantly, they were able to support vitality in ways that prevent illness and encourage wellness. Vitality is an expression of energy.</p><p>Meridian Massage is a hands-on modern application of this ancient wisdom to balance mind, body, and spirit for health and happiness. Knowing how to work directly with energy opens a powerful dimension for massage therapists and bodyworkers to access through their work. An organized and practical integration of modern energy work and ancient Chinese medicine, Meridian Massage can complement any form of hands-on healing.</p></p><p>The founder of Big Tree School of Natural Healing, she is an acupuncturist and a massage therapist with more than twenty years&#39; experience as a teacher and hands-on practitioner. She integrates Classical Chinese medicine and Western massage therapy in a unique approach to balancing mind, body, and spirit-a practice known as Meridian Massage. Her profound thinking, humor, and unique ability to make the complex accessible combine to help these much-needed teachings inspire many people throughout the world.Through her book Meridian Massage, Cindy Black lays out the principles and practice of an innovative yet deep-rooted approach to therapeutic bodywork. It is the product of her long experience as a massage practitioner, her capacity for clear and thorough instruction, her profound grasp of traditional Chinese medicine, and above all her intuitive ability to synthesize from these attributes a potent tool of transformative healing touch. The book provides a detailed and elegantly illustrated guide to that therapeutic tool - one that is grounded, the author writes, "in combining detailed anatomical understanding of the meridians and acupoint locations with the sensitivity of the practitioner." Indeed, the effectiveness and brilliance of this simple, subtle system of bodywork relies, in no small measure, on the energetic receptivity and understanding that Cindy Black so expertly applies and conveys. Bodywork practitioners and enthusiasts alike will find that Meridian Massage both informs and transforms, instructs and inspires. -<b> Gabriel Mojay LicAc, CertEd, FIFPA Principal of the Institute of Traditional Herbal Medicine and Aromatherapy, London Author of Aromatherapy for Healing the Spirit and co-author of Shiatsu - The Complete Guide</b><br><br>Cindy Black has accomplished the impressive task of distilling the fundamentals from the vast system of traditional Chinese medicine, and creating a clearly descriptive and beautifully illustrated book. Due to her experience as a Licensed Acupuncturist, she is adept at explaining this ancient system and its practical uses for all hands-on therapists. As a professional bodyworker and instructor, I consider this book a valuable asset for myself, my students, and my clients. It serves as an accessible entryway to understanding our energetic anatomy and its significant relationship to our health. In the classroom, Cindy displays an unusual talent of clear presentation combined with sharp wit and humor, which consistently makes learning a pleasure by bringing her material alive. That she has also accomplished this task with her book is another testament to her expertise. Her book is perfect for massage therapists and other hands-on healers. I would also highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the ancient art of Chinese medicine and their own remarkable, potent energy for healing. - <b>Bernadette Fiocca, LMT (Private Practice since 1984) Shiatsu and Energy Palpation Instructor at Finger Lakes School of Massage, Ithaca, NY.</b><br><br>Great bodyworkers find the midpoint between their clients' energy and their own, and work from that space. They are able to strip away who they think they are, what they feel they need to do, and whom they think the person on their table is, in order to be guided from that harmonious place. Meridian Massage: Opening Pathways to Vitality is not just a valuable instruction manual, resource, or reference book. Rather, unlike other books of its nature, it also affords guidance to the practitioner about how to access the Qi of the meridians. She encourages us to do the necessary inner work to cultivate our own Qi, in order to tap into the spirit of the points without the use of needles. This book is filled with depth and reverence for an ancient art, interwoven with the wisdom of the Tao. It offers a fresh perspective which is refreshing and sometimes humorous, never dry and rote. Descriptions are vivid, stories are poignant, her writing is engaging, and her passion is evident. In a way that is easily digestible, Cindy has made available to modern practitioners a buffet to savor. - <b>Teresa L Crosier, D.O.M., Dipl. C.M., Dipl.

He is the critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling author an award-winning body of work which includes, SOMEWHERE IN THE DARKNESS, SLAM!, and MONSTER. Mr. Myers has received two Newbery Honor medals, five Coretta Scott King Author Awards, and three National Book Award Finalists citations. In addition, he is the winner of the first Michael L. Printz Award. He lives in Jersey City, New Jersey.<br>Grade 6 Up. A visually striking, oversized picture book. Walter Dean Myers's songlike poem relates the story of a group of people who settled in New York City, hoping to improve their lots in life, only to discover that racism could still keep them from achieving success. Well-known Harlem landmarks, such as the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater, are mentioned, as are famous African Americans, like Langston Hughes and Joe Louis. The pain of discrimination is made abundantly clear through Myers's forceful, often bitter words. The pride and determination of the people of Harlem are also demonstrated, as is their at times overwhelming despair. The bold collage and ink drawings complement the text well. Although the book paints a vibrant picture of the area and its residents, it is difficult to imagine its proposed audience. Many young people will not be able to grasp the subtleties and imagery of the poem or understand its frequent cultural references. The artwork is fresh and eye-catching, but it, too, is sophisticated. Overall, this is an arresting and heartfelt tribute to a well-known, but little understood, community that may take a bit of effort to sell.?Melissa Hudak, North Suburban District Library, Roscoe, IL<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Unrepeatable: Cultivating the Unique Calling of Every Person</h2><p><b><p>"Beautifully written, compellingly personal, and a treasure to read."<br> Most Rev.

WORK WELL, PLAY WELL:<br>a Scandinavian education<p></p> <br>&#x201c;Everyone has to take part&#x201d; &#x2013; Else Mathiassen<br> <br>It could be any old school disco. In the sports hall, the cool kids bounce around to loud music. In the playground, the shy ones look at their shoes, shivering. At some point, a young woman wrapped in an inflatable orange tube bursts from the sports hall and pinballs across the playground, aiming a large yellow water gun at all those who cross her path. This is the end-of-year party at Ingrid Jespersen High School &#x2013; theme: &#x201c;beach&#x201d;; weather: Danish &#x2013; but not all of those present share their classmate&#x2019;s exuberance. It&#x2019;s a cold night, and perhaps they regret obeying the Hawaiian dress code with quite such diligence.<br> <br>Some feet away in the sports hall, a few hundred other sixth-formers are having a better time of it. Ringed with garlands of fake flowers, they bump to Rihanna, and Danish artists like Kidd and Malk de Koijn. Every so often they&#x2019;ll thrust their way towards the makeshift bar where their teachers &#x2013; known, like all Danish teachers, by their first names &#x2013; happily hand out pints of beer. In the corners, couples make out. People are merry, but not blotto. In a last hurrah before next week&#x2019;s exams, most of them are having fun. Still, something makes me anxious. First up, I feel like I&#x2019;ve been here before. Second: I keep thinking that something unspeakably evil is about to happen.<br> <br>In a way, I&#x2019;m partly right. I have been here before &#x2013; at least, I&#x2019;ve seen this place on screen. It&#x2019;s the playground where they filmed the school scenes from the first season of The Killing. Much of the plot of the first few episodes revolves around what happens one night at a school disco &#x2013; a disco, slightly disconcertingly, that is rather like this one. At first, you think a girl&#x2019;s been kidnapped at the party. Then you think she&#x2019;s been murdered in the basement. Finally, you suspect someone else has been raped &#x2013; or, at the very least, filmed having group sex. I look around. Where&#x2019;s the camera? Where&#x2019;s the basement? Who&#x2019;s the killer? But these aren&#x2019;t the only questions I&#x2019;m wrestling with. I came here tonight fascinated mostly by the school&#x2019;s connections to Danish television. I&#x2019;ve ended up just as intrigued by what the school says about the Danish education system, and, in fact, Denmark itself.<br> <br>In a way, Ingrid Jespersen is not very representative of Denmark at all. It&#x2019;s quite elitist, in fact. It&#x2019;s a private school, it&#x2019;s in a posh bit of Copenhagen and the offspring of three very different, very high-profile politicians all go here &#x2013; the daughter of the social democratic prime minister; the daughter of the leader of the Danish Lib Dems; and the grandchild of Pia Kjaersgaard, the one-time leader of &#x2013; for want of a better comparison &#x2013; the Danish equivalent of the BNP.<br> <br>But as Rihanna throbs away in the background, one thing fascinates me. If this is a private school, why does the government subsidise around 80% of the school fees?<br> <br>�<br> <br>It&#x2019;s sometimes claimed that Denmark is a classless society. While this is obviously a sizeable exaggeration &#x2013; as the fictional prime minister in Borgen says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a myth that we&#x2019;re all equal&#x201d; &#x2013; a lot of the state apparatus is nevertheless tilted towards lessening social divisions. The subsidy for private education is a good example of this. It&#x2019;s given to all those who want to study privately in Denmark, and accordingly it shows you both how large the Danish state is &#x2013; and how committed that state is to creating equality. True, the students at Ingrid Jespersen come, on the whole, from wealthier backgrounds than their counterparts at Danish state schools. But they also represent a far wider social range than those at an equivalent private school in Britain. Twelve hours before the disco got going, I spent the morning interviewing a class that was at the end of their second year of three at Ingrid Jespersen. Put your hands up, I said, if you would struggle to come here without the subsidy. Around half the class did &#x2013; which tells its own story. &#x201c;If my parents had to pay for everything at this school, I couldn&#x2019;t afford to come,&#x201d; says one, an 18-year-old called Rasmus. Like many youngsters in Denmark, he speaks very precise, almost flawless English. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have that money. The state covers most of the expenses.&#x201d; Naturally, places like this are still seen as elitist &#x2013; but they don&#x2019;t have quite the same stigma that they do in Britain, and they&#x2019;re much more mixed.<br> <br>The knock-on effect is that as a group the students are more grounded and more socially conscious than you&#x2019;d expect their British equivalents to be. A while back, Class 2B went on an exchange to a private school in Scotland, which shall remain nameless. Put simply, they were shocked at the social divisions they came across there. &#x201c;In Scotland, they mentioned 'working class&#x2019;,&#x201d; remembers Rasmus, sitting next to a shelf of test tubes. &#x201c;In Denmark, of course we have that, but the difference is not very great. You can go from working class to upper class if you get a good job. And if you get an education you should be able to get a good job.&#x201d; It also helps that the wage disparity between different jobs is not particularly large, which means that Danes are less snooty about what jobs people do. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t look down upon any specific jobs,&#x201d; says Rasmus. &#x201c;If you left school at 16 and became a garbage man, it might pay almost as good as a doctor. It&#x2019;s not easy, but you can do it.&#x201d; Again, this is an exaggeration &#x2013; but the broad gist is correct. Thanks to the strength of the Danish trade unions, a doctor earns on average only twice as much as a refuse collector, a judge only two and a half times more than a cleaner. According to the Gini index, which measures income disparity, the gap between rich and poor in Denmark is currently the lowest in the world.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s important not to read too much into what one class of Danes thought of one class of Scots (and it would be amusing to hear what the Scots thought of the Danes) but their thoughts are useful in that they hint at what&#x2019;s different about Danish education, and, by extension, Danish society.<br> <br>&#x201c;When you compare us to other EU countries, our education is very badly rated,&#x201d; says 17-year-old Augusta. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not brought up to learn things by heart. But if you ask Danish students and Danish children about politics, we&#x2019;re more reflective. We have more of our own views. We think more about our society. We sensed in Scotland that they are taught in a more old-fashioned way.&#x201d;<br> <br>You could argue that this approach starts from the age of six months. At this point in a Danish child&#x2019;s life, state-subsidised childcare kicks in &#x2013; which means that parents pay no more than 25% of the cost of sending their child to nursery (around �300 a month). If they&#x2019;re low earners, they pay far less &#x2013; and in turn this means that everyone can and does put their children in childcare from an early age. This has two main effects. It encourages the vast majority of women to go back to work. Over 70% of Danish mothers are in work &#x2013; in Britain, that figure falls to 55%. Second, it means that children from the age of six months are a) separated from their parents for large parts of the day; and b) surrounded by kids of all backgrounds.<br> <br>There are many criticisms of these nurseries; one common view is that the education they provide is not structured enough. But their many supporters argue that they teach Danish children to be more independent, and, by introducing them to other people from all walks of life, they also make them aware of the importance of society, and of cooperating with your equals &#x2013; a recurrent theme in Denmark, and, in fact, this book. Only in Denmark could there be a board game &#x2013; Konsensus &#x2013; based around the concept of collaboration. It&#x2019;s no coincidence that the name of the Danes&#x2019; most famous export &#x2013; Lego toys &#x2013; is derived from the Danish words &#x201c;leg godt&#x201d;. Play well.<br> <br><br> <br>This focus on independence extends outside the school gates, too. Since cycling and cycling infrastructure are so widespread, children are often allowed to roam around town at a younger age than they might do abroad. &#x201c;Our parents don&#x2019;t have to drive us,&#x201d; says S�ren, a chap with the beginnings of some lengthy dreadlocks. &#x201c;We take care of our own transportation from an early age. We don&#x2019;t have to have a driving licence to get around. At ten or 11, you can go to a lot of places yourself on your bike. It&#x2019;s normal to do it at nine.&#x201d; A quarter of children aged between seven and 14 have part-time jobs.<br> <br>Teenagers can also get their hands on alcohol much more easily &#x2013; and in fact they drink more alcohol per capita than youngsters in any other country. You can buy booze as early as 16, and people aren&#x2019;t prompted for their ID as often as they are in other countries. Meanwhile parents often give their 14-year-olds cans of beer to take to a party &#x2013; an attempt to moderate their drinking without banning it completely. Opinion is divided as to the effect this all has. Predictably some think it encourages binging; others argue the opposite &#x2013; that it makes alcohol less of an issue. &#x201c;I think we drink differently to how they do in the UK,&#x201d; argues Benedicte, 17. &#x201c;The people going out there &#x2013; they were drunk. They were REALLY drunk. We tend to just get tipsy.&#x201d; Some of her classmates argue that the class&#x2019;s attitude to binging is unusual. But most of them claim it&#x2019;s standard for Danes their age &#x2013; that while Danish teens drink more often, they usually do it in moderation, and in less pressurised circumstances.<br> <br>In a year or two, this class will start to think about university. The decision they face is different from that faced by students in Britain. Here, there has been a fierce debate about whether the rise in university fees from �9000 to �27,000 will prove off-putting to those from poorer backgrounds. In Denmark, that premise seems farcical. University education is entirely free. In fact, Danish students are in a sense paid to go to university: they receive around �500 a month in living expenses. It&#x2019;s a different mentality. Students aren&#x2019;t seen as a burden on the state, but as people whose skills will one day support it. They&#x2019;re future participants in Danish life, and they&#x2019;re treated as such. Every effort is made to make them better able to participate.<br> <br>In Denmark, a well-rounded personality is seen as a key component of this ability to participate, which helps explain the existence of two very Danish institutions that have few overseas equivalents: the continuation school, and the folk high school. The former is the state-subsidised boarding school where many 16-year-olds go to study in the year before they leave for sixth form. They follow a basic academic curriculum, but the main focus is on creativity. Some continuation schools specialise in sport, others centre on drama and art, and some are essentially music schools. Their sole goals are to develop the students&#x2019; extra-curricular interests, and to help them &#x2013; at a pivotal moment in their lives &#x2013; mature as human beings. The folk high school is a very similar concept, but it&#x2019;s aimed at those who have already left school &#x2013; adults of any age, in fact &#x2013; and there are no exams.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of this Danish tradition that everyone has to take part in political life, or in life in general,&#x201d; says Else Mathiassen, who runs the West Jutland folk high school. &#x201c;Each individual should be developed in his or her own way &#x2013; but also know how to function within a group. And to do that, you need to be enlightened! You have to be personally enlightened in order to know about society today. To enable you to be part of the democracy that we have.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s easy to be cynical about such idealism. As the fictional leader of the Social Democrats admits in Borgen: &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t run anything.&#x201d; But walking around the grounds of the high school, you can see why Else&#x2019;s so inspired. We&#x2019;re halfway up the coast of the North Sea &#x2013; as far from Copenhagen as you can really get in Denmark &#x2013; and the place is dreamy. At its centre is an airy hub of bedrooms and workshops that open out onto acres of gardens and woodland. A blue tit flutters about the art studio, and the vegetable patches are stuffed with potatoes and lemon balm. In the woods in the distance, sculptures made by recent students poke from the trees. The whole estate smells of spring.<br> <br>There are 70 of these places in Denmark, and one in ten Danish adults &#x2013; with half of their fees paid for by the state &#x2013; will spend a spell at one at some point in their lives. Most people tend to come in their twenties, but parents and pensioners often enrol too. In fact, the schools hold such a special place in the Danish identity that Else thinks that the very elderly sometimes come here to pass away. &#x201c;Sometimes older people die here, and I have to ring up the family to break them the news,&#x201d; she explains. &#x201c;Often they&#x2019;ll say: &#x2018;Oh, that&#x2019;s nice, he obviously wanted to die in a folk high school.&#x2019; &#x201d; Each school has its own specialism &#x2013; West Jutland is particularly known for its focus on eco-living &#x2013; but all of them will teach dancing, writing, ceramics, painting, acting, cooking, gardening, debating and philosophy. The last two are particularly important because the ability to articulate an argument is a key part of being an active citizen.<br> <br>This highly democratic approach to education is not a recent Danish phenomenon. It can be seen in the context of a wider drive towards social democracy that began in Denmark around 150 years ago. The roots of Danish educational ideology, like many Danish concepts, can be traced to the mid-1800s, when the country was in the process of losing much of its southern (and historically German) territory to a newly belligerent Prussia. In 1864, Denmark finally surrendered its two southernmost provinces, Schleswig and Holstein, to Prussia, a defeat which saw the country lose 40% of its population. It was a moment of huge national trauma. Until that point, Denmark still rather optimistically saw itself as a relatively powerful, multinational commonwealth, despite having regularly lost large parts of its empire since the 1500s. But in 1864, with the loss of their last significant annex, the Danes had finally to accept that their once-vast medieval empire &#x2013; a Baltic sprawl that had housed several states and a babble of languages &#x2013; was in fact now just one single, tiny monoculture. This prompted a national identity crisis, and forced Danes to reassess the values that united them.<br><br><br> <br>Nikolai Grundtvig<br><br>The debate was heavily influenced by the ideas of a man called Nikolai Grundtvig, who is now considered a Danish national hero. By the late 1840s, Denmark had finally made the transition from absolute monarchy to parliamentary monarchy. In very simplistic terms, Grundtvig &#x2013; a priest, thinker, and sometime politician active from the 1830s onwards &#x2013; felt that the new democratic system would work only if every Dane was able to participate in political life, and if, by extension, Danish society was made more egalitarian. From 1838, as the campaign for democracy gathered pace, he gave a series of lectures promoting the concept of what he coined folkelighed, or what the historian Knud Jespersen translates as a &#x201c;mutually committed community&#x201d;. Grundtvig, writes Jespersen in his highly recommended A History of Denmark, &#x201c;was particularly concerned with the question of how to transform the hitherto inarticulate general public into responsible citizens in the coming democracy &#x2013; in other words, to turn the humble subjects of the king into good democrats&#x201d;.<br> <br>His arguments had a huge ef...</p><h2>Sunny, Vol. 1 (1)</h2><p>The latest manga masterpiece from the Eisner Award-winning creator of Tekkonkinkreet.<br><br>What is Sunny? Sunny is a car. Sunny is a car you take on a drive with your mind. It takes you to the place of your dreams. <br><br> Sunny is the story of beating the odds, in the ways that count. It&#x2019;s the brand-new masterwork from Eisner Award-winner Taiyo Matsumoto, one of Japan&#x2019;s most innovative and acclaimed manga artists. <br><br> Translated by Tekkonkinkreet film director Michael Arias!<br><br> Reads R to L (Japanese Style) for teen audiences.</p><p>One of the most influential and innovative manga artists currently working in Japan, Taiyo Matsumoto is best known to English-reading audiences as the creator of GoGo Monster, Number Five, and Tekkonkinkreet, which was made into a critically acclaimed animated film of the same name. In 2007, Matsumoto was awarded a Japan Media Arts Festival Award for Excellence, and in 2008, he won the prestigious Eisner Award for the English publication of Tekkonkinkreet.To adults, the Nissan Sunny 1200 may look like a broken-down old car in front of a Japanese home for orphans. To the children and teens of the orphanage, though, the Sunny is a clubhouse, a spaceship, a getaway vehicle, and one of the few places that is truly theirs after they are abandoned by their parents. Readers catch glimpses of each of the orphans&#x2019; lives, both the imaginary adventures they devise while in the Sunny and the sometimes heartbreaking ones outside of it. Matsumoto is probably best known for his Eisner Award&#x2013;winning title, Tekkon Kinkreet (2007), about orphan street kids trying to protect their town from invading Yakuza. He returns to those themes in this latest work and combines evocative art and concise dialogue to tell the melancholy story of the kids and teens who use the Sunny to escape their problematic home lives. This title would appeal to fans of atmospheric titles such as Benjamin&#x2019;s Orange (2009) and Yuki Obata&#x2019;s We Were There (2013).

This accessible guide gives step-by-step instructions for people who feel tight or older than they should, people with poor posture, athletes who want to boost their performance, and those who want something more than conventional stretching. This book provides you with many different stretches for the whole body including the hands and feet, as well as routines for specific goals such as improving posture, helping office workers stay healthy, stretching the back, and more. Even those with sedentary lives will see and feel a difference, with just 10-20 minutes of stretching yielding benefits that may last the whole day.<br><br>Many of us are limited in our movements, hunched over, or tight. Ideally we would move in a variety of ways throughout the day, keeping our bodies fresh and youthful. However, office jobs and sofas can lead to bodies that are imprisoned in a cage of tension, whose tissue is dehydrated and stuck together, with some areas that are very weak or tight. Normal stretching is not strong enough to break us out of that state. When we tense our bodies and move through that tension, we engage the fascia and recondition it into a more youthful state, restoring great posture, elasticity, and power.</p><p><b>Suzanne Wylde</b> is the founder of Moving Stretch, a unique system of accessible, effective, and powerful stretches. She began her career with a degree in Traditional Chinese medicine, which included study in hospitals in Beijing. Since then she has worked for the NHS and has run her private practice for over a decade, gaining experience in working with a wide range of physical issues including chronic pain, sports injuries, issues caused by physical tension such as migraine, ME, and other issues.

The Real Books are the best-selling jazz books of all time. Since the 1970s, musicians have trusted these volumes to get them through every gig, night after night. The problem is that the books were illegally produced and distributed without any copyrights or royalties paid to the master composers who created these musical canons. Hal Leonard is very proud to present the first legitimate and legal editions of these books ever produced. You won't even notice the difference...the covers look the same, the engravings look the same, the songlist is nearly identical, and the price remains fair even on a musician's salary! But every conscientious musician will appreciate that these books are now produced legally and ethically, benefitting the songwriters that we owe for some of the greatest music ever written! 400 songs, including: Ain't Misbehavin' * All or Nothing at All * Along Came Betty * Cheek to Cheek * East of the Sun (And West of the Moon) * Funkallero * H &amp; H * I've Got the World on a String * I've Got You Under My Skin * The Jive Samba * The Lady Is a Tramp * Milestones * Moonlight in Vermont * A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square * On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever) * Samba De Orfeu * Stormy Weather (Keeps Rainin' All the Time) * Things Ain't What They Used to Be * The Very Thought of You * Violets for Your Furs * Watermelon Man * and more. Editions also available in B-flat, E-flat, and Bass Clef. Looking for a particular song?

They represent many of the greatest songwriters and artists of all time and publish and distribute works from all genres of music for all styles of musicians and ensembles.</p><h2>I&#39;m Not Who You Think I Am</h2><p>Who is the strange woman in the white car watching Ginger? She appears at Ginger's birthday party, at her school, and in front of her house, but Ginger has never met her before. When she confronts Ginger, she reveals a secret that will change Ginger's life. And when the woman's confrontations become threatening, Ginger is forced into a crisis of loyalty and honor&#x2014;a crisis from which her family might never recover.</p><p>Peg Kehret was born in Wisconsin, grew up in Minnesota, spent fourteen years in California, and now lives with her husband in Washington State. They have two grown children, four grandchildren, one dog, and one cat.<p>Peg's novels for children are regularly recommended by the American Library Association, the International Reading Association, and the Children's Book Council. She has won many state "young reader" or "children's choice" awards. Peg's characters are ordinary kids who find themselves in exciting situations and who use their wits to solve their problems. There is usually humor as well as suspense in her books. A long-time volunteer at The Humane Society, she often uses animals in her stories.</p><p>Before she began writing books for children, Peg published plays, short stories, articles, and two books for adults. She is a frequent speaker at conferences for librarians and teachers.</p><p>At the age of twelve, Peg had polio and was paralyzed from the neck down. Because she can remember that experience and her year of recovery so vividly, she finds it easy to write in the viewpoint of a twelve or thirteen year old. Most of her main characters are that age. Her autobiography, <b>Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio</b>, won the Golden Kite Award from the Society of Children's Book Writers &amp; Illustrators, and the PEN Center USA West Award for Children's Literature.</p><p>When she is not writing, Peg likes to watch baseball, bake cookies, and pump her old player piano.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Grade 5-8-Two separate plot lines involve Ginger in danger and controversy. She is being stalked by a mentally ill woman who believes that the 13-year-old is her daughter. Meanwhile, Ginger's favorite teacher, Mr. Wren, is being harassed by Mrs. Vaughn, an irate and influential parent who doesn't like the way he is coaching the girls' basketball team. Ginger's parents are away on business trips, so there is no adult on the scene to turn to when she and her older sister begin to suspect that someone is watching their house. Nor can anyone advise her on what to do in the case of her teacher. Because she videotapes the school's basketball games, she has proof that Mr. Wren has done a good job of coaching. But if she makes those tapes public, her mother and sister may lose customers because Mrs. Vaughn threatens to boycott their party-planning and catering businesses. As events unfold, suspense builds. The mentally ill woman is a sinister presence, but she is not a well-developed character. Mrs. Vaughn is the quintessential obnoxious parent, pushy and self-centered. Ginger is a plucky, thoughtful young teen. When the two plots converge in the final scenes, everything is resolved satisfactorily. This enjoyable novel will draw readers' interest and keep them turning pages. The message, that a person should follow her conscience and do the right thing in spite of the expected consequences, is one that young people will understand and appreciate.<br><i>Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Merck&#x2019;s 1899 Manual of the Materia Medica</h2><p>Together With a Summary of Therapeutic Indications and a Classification of Medicaments; A Ready-Reference Pocket Book for the Practicing Physician; Containing Names and Chief Synonyms, Physical Form and Appearance, Solubilities<br><br>Sozolic acid.
